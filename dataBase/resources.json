Rules, after all, are meant to be broken, and there are many alternative \nengagement rings that may better fit their personality, desires &hellip; and your budget. Here \nare a few of the many non-traditional engagement rings that will last for a lifetime of \ntogetherness. Alternative To What? Traditional engagement rings typically involve some sort \nof diamond taking center stage &mdash; like a solitaire diamond ring with a platinum setting \nor a larger carat cushion cut diamond surrounded by a halo of smaller stones. Those classic \nstyles definitely transcend trends, but they also often come at price points outside your \nbudget. Alternative options give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to colors, styles and \nprices. Plus, choosing an alternative metal, stone or style allows you to flex your creativity to \ncreate a more personalized custom engagement ring. Types Of Alternative Engagement \nRings The good news is the options are virtually endless when creating a meaningful \nalternative ring. (Psst: It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a ring. You can give an engagement \nnecklace, watch or earrings if that&rsquo;s more your speed!) With that in mind, here are a \nfew alternative options you may not have thought of when you begin your search for the \nperfect engagement ring: Moissanite Engagement Rings If the wow factor of a large natural \ndiamond doesn&rsquo;t mesh with your budget, consider going the moissanite route. This \nsuper hard, scratch-resistant stone gives the look and brilliance of a diamond without the \ncost. That means you can buy a much larger stone with a much smaller price tag. morganite \nengagement rings Her wedding colors don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;blush and \nbashful&rdquo; (name that movie!) to love the delicate pink tint of a morganite gemstone. \nChoose a simple pear-shaped gem with a rose gold band for a monochromatic masterpiece, \nor up the glam factor with a romantic diamond halo surrounding an oval-shaped center \nstone. sapphire engagement rings Are you Team Diana, Team Kate Middleton or somewhere \nin between? If so, consider the royal aesthetic and centuries-old beauty of a sapphire. This \nblue gemstone is great for daily wear owing to its durability, and you can go with a single \nstone on a gold band, make it flashier with surrounding diamonds or white sapphires, or \nchoose a sapphire band with inset stones. If you want a bright pink gemstone that&rsquo;s \nmore vibrant than morganite, select a unique pink sapphire. ruby engagement rings Let the \nfiery passion of your relationship match the center stone of a ruby engagement ring. Choose \na round cut ruby gemstone surrounded by a halo of moissanite gemstones for a deeply \nromantic piece of jewelry. The deep red gives the piece a unique touch that will stand out on \ntheir finger. amethyst engagement rings If you don&rsquo;t go the traditional route, consider \nchoosing a ring that commemorates a February birthday. The deep purple hue of amethyst \npromises a dreamy mystique while incorporating a bit of personalization into the ring. Select \nan opulent design with a rose gold metal to really accentuate the amethyst tone. topaz \nengagement rings Looking for a vintage non-traditional engagement ring? A rich blue topaz \nring gives the look of something old while serving as their &ldquo;something blue.&rdquo; \nSelect a stunning Art Deco-style ring featuring a large, sparkling topaz stunner that promises \nthe wow-factor she craves. aquamarine engagement rings Capture the tranquility of the \nocean or the gentleness of her spirit with the quiet brilliance of an aquamarine ring. Choose \nfrom a range of shapes, sizes and settings, whether she prefers the look of an emerald-cut \nstone surrounded by diamonds in a white gold setting or a vintage-style setting featuring a \npear-shaped aquamarine. stacking band engagement rings If your bride-to-be prefers a \nmore delicate style, go with the look of a single band, whether a plain yellow or white gold \nring, or something with a row of diamonds or gemstones. A single band speaks to classic \nsimplicity, perfect for the minimalist bride who loves clean lines and understated elegance. \nAdd extra bands over time, whether for an anniversary, the birth of a child, a special \noccasion or a holiday. Or plan to propose with three stacked bands that coordinate with her \nsophisticated style. completely unique engagement rings Anything can be an engagement \nring &mdash; a paperclip, a gumball machine treasure, a birthstone band, even a thicker \nmen&rsquo;s wedding band, if that&rsquo;s more their speed. Whatever ring you select will \n\nhave its own special meaning for all of eternity. Design Your Own One-Of-A-Kind Engagment \nRing Can&rsquo;t find a ring that fulfills all of her desires? Make your own! Designing a \ncustom engagement ring will give you the chance to flex some creativity while ensuring you \nfind exactly what you want. You can even get your partner in on the action by going together \nto pick out a stone, select a setting and choose a style. Adding an engraved inscription inside \nthe ring &mdash; whether a wedding date, your initials or a short quotation &mdash; can \nmake it even more unique and meaningful. FAQ's What Makes An Engagement Ring \nAlternative? Anything non-traditional is considered an alternative, meaning the ring \nwon&rsquo;t be your traditional solitaire diamond band. Alternative rings take an unexpected \nmaterial or stray from that traditional diamond into something that better fits with your unique \nstyle. Can I Create My Own Engagement Ring? Absolutely! Your engagement ring should be \na reflection of the wearer and their relationship. Creating your own unique ring is the way to \ngo to ensure that you hit all the must-haves. You can use an online ring tool to virtually build \nand order an engagement ring right from home, or you can work with an in-store jeweler to \nfind your one-of-a-kind masterpiece. What Should I Look For In A Unique Engagement Ring? \nFind an engagement ring that speaks to her personality and style. If she has an affinity for \nmodern and flashy, you might choose a custom morganite ring with a diamond band. If her \nstyle is more pared down and minimalist, a simple band with a few small gemstones may fit \nthe bill. If she wants something completely different, say a thicker silicone band, that works \ntoo!\n\namerican gem society The American Gem Society (AGS) is a non-profit trade association of \njewelers dedicated to setting, maintaining and promoting the highest standards of ethical and \nprofessional behavior through education, accreditation and gemological research.

A cushion diamond has a soft, \n\nromantic appeal and is sometimes known as a pillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds \nemerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut diamond has the same number of facets as \nround and princess cut diamonds, it is the parallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color \nand clarity. The best way to describe the emerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a \nlarge table and step-cut faceting that creates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric \ndiamond shape is rare: only 3 percent of all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut \ndiamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval cut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated \nsilhouette to appear larger. A brilliant facet pattern means the diamond sparkles as well as a \nround or princess cut, and the exquisite oval shape appeals to any bride, whether she \nprefers classic or more modern looks.

Shop \nradiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon shape has cropped corners and \nmesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. The Asscher, developed during \nthe Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald cut. The Asscher is most \nwell-known for its X-shaped facets that can be seen from above.

The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most? Reflected by their \nwidespread popularity, round diamonds are the pinnacle in brilliance. Most commonly cut \nwith 58 facets that reflect light, round brilliant diamonds are nearly unmatched when it comes \nto shine. How Does Diamond Shape Affect the Price of a Ring? A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size. Because fancy \nshapes, such as pear, oval and marquise, are elongated, they tend to look larger than round \ndiamonds. Which Diamond Shapes Are the Largest? Marquise diamonds have the largest \nface-up area of any diamond cut — approximately 15 percent larger than round diamonds. \nThey also cost less than round diamonds of the same carat. schedule an appointment Not \nsure what diamond shape is best for your partner's future engagement ring?

Diamond \n\ngrading reports, based on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide \nbuyers with assurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have \nbeen graded by some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® \nand GCAL. For every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, \nwhich assesses a stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading \nreport? Diamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at \nindependent grading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on \nimportant characteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are \nincluded in a diamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, \nthe grading lab issues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores \nfor each of the fundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity \nand carat weight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. \nThe most common carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide \nvariety of sizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of \nissued grading reports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes \ncan be identified. Diamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports \ninclude proportions diagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to \nthe culet (the small facet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the \namount of natural color present within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a \ngrade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, \nthe less natural color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also \nmeasure a diamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. \nBluish fluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or \nunder fluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar \ncarat weight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond. Helzberg offers detailed \nreports for every graded diamond we sell. With ethical sourcing of our materials and strict \ndiamond quality standards, we go above and beyond industry standards to provide each \ncustomer with the exceptional quality that has defined the Helzberg name for over a century. \nwhy does helzberg use multiple labs? Our approach to fine jewelry is Quality Over \nEverything, which is why we partner with some of the diamond industry’s most trusted, \n\nindependent grading labs. Their sole purpose is to validate diamond quality through detailed \ngrading reports. Though these reports include ratings or scores based on similar \ncharacteristics, the way they are measured differs from lab to lab — and from natural and lab \ngrown diamonds to gemstones. We look to these experts to ensure you get the highest \nquality stone available, no matter which you choose. more advice engagement buying guide \nFinding the perfect engagement ring can be overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.

Then create your own! \nPartner with our jewelry experts to select your center stone and setting, then have it come to \n\nlife with expert craftsmanship and quality. Get started What is an engagement ring setting? \nThe term &ldquo;setting&rdquo; refers to how a gem is mounted, or set, into a precious \nmetal band. Ideally, an engagement ring's setting should showcase the beauty of the \ngemstone while reflecting the unique personality of the wearer. In addition to determining \nhow the engagement ring will look, the setting will help determine what kind of diamond or \ngemstone you will buy. Channel-set ring Channel settings do not include beads, prongs or \nany fixtures in between the stones. Instead, the gems are set adjacent to each other with \nonly the minimum amount of space separating them. This row of closely set diamonds is \nsecured in place by metal bars on either side. Channel-set diamonds are known for their \ncontinuous sparkle all the way around the ring band. Cathedral setting ring The -->cathedral \nsetting--> features a center gemstone flanked by metal arches that rise from the shank. This \nelevated profile secures the stone in place, while giving it a very distinct profile. It also \ncreates what looks similar to a basket on the underside of the engagement ring. The setting \nis reminiscent of the lovely arches in ceilings and doorways of Gothic-style cathedrals. \nDiamond prong setting types Prong choice is a very important part of the ring selection \nprocess. Strong prongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter \nyour diamond or other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or \nsix prongs evenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- \nand six-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring. Helzberg sells \nsettings without the stone in stores, but not online. find a store How long does it take to set \nan engagement ring?

Unfortunately, improper care can shorten the life of your \npiece and diminish its beauty. Here’s a quick guide to help keep your fine jewelry looking as \ngood as the day you bought it for many years to come. --> jewelry care From regular \ncleaning to smart storage, a lot goes into preserving the look and durability of gems, \nprecious metals and the craftsmanship that holds them all together. While periodic cleaning \ncan help keep your jewelry looking great, you can also help preserve its luster by taking a \nhands-off approach. When you handle your jewelry, the oils from your fingers can diminish its \nappearance. When possible, try to limit how often you handle your jewelry to reduce the \nneed for cleaning. When getting ready for the workday or a fun night on the town, it's always \nbest to put your rings, bracelets and necklaces on last. This will help prevent makeup from \nsticking to your jewelry and keep gems from snagging on clothing and loosening from their \nsettings. You should also familiarize yourself with some fundamental concepts to help you \ncare for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions While it's important to know how to \nproperly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to know what not to do. For regular \ncleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean polishing cloth and specially made \ngem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, ordinary degreasing dish soap is \nthe safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid harsh cleansers and don’t use hot \nwater. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive household cleaners to clean \njewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage many precious gems and \nmetals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot water. Try to limit how \nmuch you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this can cause the color to \nfade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious stones. how to store jewelry \nProper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or tarnished over time. It’s \nimportant to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the tarnishing process. Use a \ndehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep your jewelry out in the \nopen. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store different types of jewelry \nseparately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's best to store your diamond \npieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer gems. You can also wrap \nyour diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage.

Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \n\npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal. While \nmost black titanium in the market is plated, Helzberg only offers Benchmark black titanium, a \ntrue black metal titanium that gets its beautiful look from a proprietary alloying and heating \nprocess. Shop titanium jewelry stainless steel Stainless steel is a metal composed of iron \nalloy and a minimum of 10.5% of chromium. The chromium makes the metal resistant to \nstaining, corroding and oxidation. Stainless steel comes in many grades, meaning it has a \nvariety of uses — including jewelry! This hard, durable and affordable metal is most \n\ncommonly available in an attractive light gray, making it an appealing metal for men's jewelry. \nShop stainless steel jewelry cobalt Often called cobalt chrome, this metal is an excellent \nchoice for men's wedding bands. With its beautiful luster and high durability, cobalt looks \nsimilar to white gold and is a long-lasting choice that will maintain its beauty for years to \ncome. Shop cobalt jewelry zirconium Often confused with titanium, zirconium is a refractive \nmetal commonly used in industrial applications and, more recently, in jewelry. In its natural \nstate, the metal is a silvery gray, but it attains a black appearance after a heating process. A \ndurable, lustrous metal, black zirconium is a bold and handsome metal option. Shop \nzirconium jewelry elysium To create an elysium ring, thousands of diamonds are fused \ntogether with incredible heat under one million pounds of pressure. This creates a 100% \ndiamond piece that's extremely lightweight, hypoallergenic and comfortable. Known for its \nsignature black color, elysium jewelry requires no special care and will never dull, fade, \nscratch or change color. Elysium rings are the hardest and most scratch-resistant rings on \nthe planet and cannot be resized by a jeweler. Shop elysium jewelry damascus steel Named \nfor the capital city of Syria, Damascus steel refers to the forged wootz crucible steel used in \nthe creation of blades and swords from ancient times. Made using iron alloys, modern \nDamascus steel jewelry is crafted by placing contrasting metals of various shades (often \ngray and silver) in layers. These layers are then bonded using high heat and shaped by a \ncomplicated and artistic process resulting in beautiful patterns. Shop damascus steel jewelry \nmeteorite A meteorite is a chunk of debris from a meteoroid originating from outer space. \nMeteorite jewelry is usually made from iron meteorites. While there are all sorts of iron \nmeteorites, some are more common than others, including Gibeon meteorite. A very \ncompelling material for one-of-a-kind men's wedding bands, meteorite is an incredibly rare \nmaterial billions of years in the making. Because it is exceptionally rare, meteorite jewelry is \nexpensive. It also requires extra care due to its high iron content which leaves it susceptible \nto rust. Shop meteorite jewelry frequently asked questions is silver a metal?

After a while, your engagement ring can start to feel like part of your body. \nIt only makes sense that you would experience a little separation anxiety when it&rsquo;s \nnot on your finger. But should you wear your engagement ring everywhere? The short \nanswer is no, you should not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re \nhere to help you decide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of \ndamage or an unfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your \nengagement ring every day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their \nrings every chance they get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special \ntimes when you really want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond \nengagement ring doesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation \nstarter. Your new ring is an eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing \nimplications. It&rsquo;s only natural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story \nbehind it. Proudly show off your ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. \nDo: A night out Gearing up for a night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with \nyour engagement ring. The brilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any \noutfit, from casual ensembles to elegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate \ndate night or attending a black-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that \nwill help you stand out. When not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances \nwhen it&rsquo;s better to store your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When \nyou&rsquo;re working up a sweat, you risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. \nYou&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to potential abrasions from weights and gym \nequipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool chlorine are other potential hazards found in \nmany fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or cooking Cooking and food prep pose a major \nrisk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products could become lodged in the ring setting, and \nyour ring could slip off when you rinse something off in the sink. When to think twice about \nwearing your engagement ring Sometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear \nyour engagement ring isn&rsquo;t straightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to \nweigh the pros and cons to help you decide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at \nhome. It depends: At work If sitting at a computer and typing up emails, reports and \npresentations sounds like part of your workday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. \nOn the other hand, if you're a mechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, \nyou get the idea), it&rsquo;s best to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: \nTraveling Should you travel with your engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For \nshort trips that pose little risk, you can probably get away with wearing your ring most of the \ntime. You can wear jewelry while going through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing \nthem in a carry-on bag. Before making a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the \npotential risks &mdash; where you&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during \nyour stay. If you're on a tropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose \nyour ring while swimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if \nit&rsquo;s really worth taking a chance on something so close to your heart.

Read on to \nlearn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right stone for your \nbudget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal fire, sparkle and \nbrilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel overwhelming. \nWhile everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what makes one diamond \nsuperior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. what are the 4cs of \ndiamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for assessing the excellence of \nany diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, color, clarity and carat weight \nwork to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are how gemologists measure \ndiamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry and proportions of the \ndiamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A skilled cutter uses \nprecise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers maximum visual effects, \nincluding brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the scattering of light into \neach color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of light produced by \nreflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends on the quality of \na diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond reaches the hands of \na diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A well-cut diamond will \nappear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear dark and dull. types of \ndiamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes through the side of the \nstone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of the stone before it can be \nreflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces — or facets — represents \nthe quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall brilliance. With well-proportioned \ncuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back through the top of the diamond. \nSuperior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut Diamond Each grading lab uses their \nown grading scale and terminology to determine a diamond's cut, based on the level of \nprecision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color Almost any naturally occurring diamond \nhas some amount of color. How much determines the quality of the diamond. While there are \ncolorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. Anytime you purchase a diamond, you \nshould expect it to have at least some trace amount of natural color. what is diamond color? \nNatural diamonds are the product of geological processes that take billions of years to \ncomplete. The chemical and physical processes yield a wide array of stones which all include \nsome varying amounts of color. In most instances, the less color a diamond has, the higher \nits quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond buyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality \nbased on the amount of color present within the stone. From white to yellow, diamonds \nreceive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. \nMost diamond buyers prefer colorless to near-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and \nJ offering optimal value for a customer's budget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds \nhave little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to the stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop \nof pure water. Because they are so rare, colorless diamonds are often the most valuable. \nNear Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless diamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint \nthat is difficult to see with the naked eye. These stones make up only 2–3 percent of all \nnatural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often the best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in \nthe middle of the diamond color chart. Unmounted faint diamonds often have a faint \nyellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked eye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer \ngreat value, as the color is often difficult to see with the untrained eye, unless compared right \nnext to a stone in the near-colorless or colorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond \ncontains small blemishes (external) and inclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The \nfewer imperfections a diamond has, the more valuable it is. The more imperfections a \ndiamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is diamond clarity? This describes the internal \nand external characteristics of a diamond. A grade is assigned to each stone, with \"IF\" \nreferring to a diamond with inclusions and \"FL\" referencing flawless clarity. Diamond buyers \nwill choose stones with some inclusions to offer the best value to their customers. At \n\nHelzberg, we offer a variety of diamond clarities sure to fit any budget. diamond clarity \ngrades Diamond clarity grades are measured by the amount of inclusions, or imperfections, \nin a stone. The below table provides definitions for each of the common diamond clarity \ngrades, so you can thoughtfully consider how visible imperfections will be. diamond clarity \nchart FL, IF These are flawless diamonds, no matter how closely you look. Flawless and \ninternally flawless are the highest, and rarest, diamond quality clarity grades. vvs1, vvs2 \nThese diamonds have very slight inclusions, visible only under a microscope. These \ninclusions are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see. vs1, vs2 These are very slightly \nincluded, difficult to see with the naked eye and somewhat difficult to see under a \nmicroscope. si1, si2 These imperfections can be seen by the trained eye under 10x \nmagnification. They might still be visible to the naked eye, but harder to see in diamonds \nsmaller than 1 carat. i1, i2, i3 These inclusions are very easy for a trained eye to see under \n10x magnification. They are also often visible to the naked eye, and in the case of I3 \ndiamonds, the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the diamond as well as impact \nits brilliance. diamond carat weight When most people think about diamond quality, their \nminds immediately focus on carat weight. While other factors are also important, carat weight \nis one of the most significant characteristics in determining a diamond's quality and price. \nwhat is a diamond carat? This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The larger \nthe carat, the pricier the diamond, although the other Cs can also work to influence the final \nprice. diamond carat chart Diamonds are available in a variety of sizes, but the most \ncommon diamond sizes range from .25 to 5 carats.

But if you prefer something different, there are plenty of other shapes \navailable to reflect your unique style and taste. what is a diamond shape? Diamonds can be \ncut into a variety of shapes. There’s an option for every bride and budget! Since every \ndiamond shape is cut to varying specifications, they will reflect light differently, giving every \nshape its own brilliance and fire. types of diamond shapes round cut diamonds The most \npopular shape of all time: the round brilliant diamond. Aside from being the most iconic \ndiamond shape, the round diamond is most loved because of its ability to sparkle brighter \nthan any other shape. Because round diamonds are the most popular and most researched \nshape, they offer the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of balancing cut, color, clarity \ngrade and price. Shop round cut diamonds princess cut diamonds The princess cut diamond \nhas a square shape with sharp angles and a similar facet pattern as the round brilliant \ndiamond, so it sparkles more than other square shapes. Sophisticated and eye-catching, the \nprincess cut is perfect for those who love symmetry, clean lines and modern design. Shop \nprincess cut diamonds cushion cut diamonds A cushion cut diamond is a square or \nrectangular shape with rounded corners, like a cross between a round and a princess cut \ndiamond. A cushion diamond has a soft, romantic appeal and is sometimes known as a \npillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds emerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut \ndiamond has the same number of facets as round and princess cut diamonds, it is the \nparallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color and clarity. The best way to describe the \nemerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a large table and step-cut faceting that \ncreates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric diamond shape is rare: only 3 percent \nof all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut diamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval \ncut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated silhouette to appear larger. A brilliant facet \npattern means the diamond sparkles as well as a round or princess cut, and the exquisite \noval shape appeals to any bride, whether she prefers classic or more modern looks.

Shop radiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon \nshape has cropped corners and mesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. \nThe Asscher, developed during the Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald \ncut.

There are many other key steps involved in the process, and it \ntakes skilled hands to ensure that a diamond is faceted to high standards. frequently asked \nquestions What Is the Difference Between Diamond Shape and Diamond Cut? The shape of \na diamond refers to the external figure or outline of the diamond (pear-shaped, cushion, \nround). The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most?

A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size.

Diamond grading reports, \nbased on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide buyers with \nassurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have been graded \nby some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® and GCAL. \nFor every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, which assesses \na stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading report? \nDiamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at independent \ngrading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on important \ncharacteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are included in a \ndiamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, the grading lab \nissues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores for each of the \nfundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity and carat \nweight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The most \ncommon carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide variety of \nsizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of issued grading \nreports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes can be identified. \nDiamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports include proportions \ndiagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to the culet (the small \nfacet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the amount of natural color \npresent within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D \n(colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, the less natural \ncolor a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also measure a \ndiamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. Bluish \nfluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or under \nfluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar carat \nweight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond.

Strong \nprongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter your diamond \nor other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or six prongs \nevenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- and \nsix-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \n\naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring. Helzberg sells \nsettings without the stone in stores, but not online. find a store How long does it take to set \nan engagement ring?

Here’s \na quick guide to help keep your fine jewelry looking as good as the day you bought it for \nmany years to come. --> jewelry care From regular cleaning to smart storage, a lot goes into \npreserving the look and durability of gems, precious metals and the craftsmanship that holds \nthem all together. While periodic cleaning can help keep your jewelry looking great, you can \nalso help preserve its luster by taking a hands-off approach. When you handle your jewelry, \nthe oils from your fingers can diminish its appearance. When possible, try to limit how often \nyou handle your jewelry to reduce the need for cleaning. When getting ready for the workday \nor a fun night on the town, it's always best to put your rings, bracelets and necklaces on last. \nThis will help prevent makeup from sticking to your jewelry and keep gems from snagging on \nclothing and loosening from their settings. You should also familiarize yourself with some \nfundamental concepts to help you care for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions \nWhile it's important to know how to properly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to \nknow what not to do. For regular cleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean \npolishing cloth and specially made gem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, \nordinary degreasing dish soap is the safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid \nharsh cleansers and don’t use hot water. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive \nhousehold cleaners to clean jewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage \nmany precious gems and metals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot \nwater. Try to limit how much you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this \ncan cause the color to fade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious \nstones. how to store jewelry Proper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or \ntarnished over time. It’s important to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the \ntarnishing process. Use a dehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep \nyour jewelry out in the open. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store \ndifferent types of jewelry separately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's \nbest to store your diamond pieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer \ngems. You can also wrap your diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage. To \nbest extend the life of your most-loved pieces, we recommend a Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan, \nwhich covers inspections and repairs on your jewelry purchases. --> --> schedule an \nappointment Learn about Helzberg’s Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan and discover all the jewelry \nwe have to offer.

For example, we set our engagement rings in gold or \nplatinum so your ring will last for years and years. Diamond fashion jewelry, on the other \nhand, is most commonly set in gold, while silver is used to give you a large look at a great \nprice. Of course, there are many types of jewelry metals out there for both women's and \nmen's jewelry alike. Our quick guide to understanding metal types is here to help sort them \nall out. Let's dive in! types of jewelry metals Some of the most common metal types used to \nmake jewelry are gold, silver and platinum. Others include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, \npalladium, cobalt, stainless steel and so many others. Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \n\nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal. While \nmost black titanium in the market is plated, Helzberg only offers Benchmark black titanium, a \ntrue black metal titanium that gets its beautiful look from a proprietary alloying and heating \nprocess. Shop titanium jewelry stainless steel Stainless steel is a metal composed of iron \nalloy and a minimum of 10.5% of chromium. The chromium makes the metal resistant to \nstaining, corroding and oxidation. Stainless steel comes in many grades, meaning it has a \nvariety of uses — including jewelry! This hard, durable and affordable metal is most \ncommonly available in an attractive light gray, making it an appealing metal for men's jewelry. \nShop stainless steel jewelry cobalt Often called cobalt chrome, this metal is an excellent \nchoice for men's wedding bands. With its beautiful luster and high durability, cobalt looks \nsimilar to white gold and is a long-lasting choice that will maintain its beauty for years to \ncome. Shop cobalt jewelry zirconium Often confused with titanium, zirconium is a refractive \nmetal commonly used in industrial applications and, more recently, in jewelry. In its natural \nstate, the metal is a silvery gray, but it attains a black appearance after a heating process. A \ndurable, lustrous metal, black zirconium is a bold and handsome metal option. Shop \nzirconium jewelry elysium To create an elysium ring, thousands of diamonds are fused \ntogether with incredible heat under one million pounds of pressure. This creates a 100% \ndiamond piece that's extremely lightweight, hypoallergenic and comfortable. Known for its \nsignature black color, elysium jewelry requires no special care and will never dull, fade, \nscratch or change color. Elysium rings are the hardest and most scratch-resistant rings on \nthe planet and cannot be resized by a jeweler. Shop elysium jewelry damascus steel Named \nfor the capital city of Syria, Damascus steel refers to the forged wootz crucible steel used in \nthe creation of blades and swords from ancient times. Made using iron alloys, modern \nDamascus steel jewelry is crafted by placing contrasting metals of various shades (often \ngray and silver) in layers. These layers are then bonded using high heat and shaped by a \ncomplicated and artistic process resulting in beautiful patterns. Shop damascus steel jewelry \nmeteorite A meteorite is a chunk of debris from a meteoroid originating from outer space. \nMeteorite jewelry is usually made from iron meteorites. While there are all sorts of iron \nmeteorites, some are more common than others, including Gibeon meteorite. A very \ncompelling material for one-of-a-kind men's wedding bands, meteorite is an incredibly rare \nmaterial billions of years in the making. Because it is exceptionally rare, meteorite jewelry is \nexpensive. It also requires extra care due to its high iron content which leaves it susceptible \nto rust. Shop meteorite jewelry frequently asked questions is silver a metal? Silver is a soft, \nlustrous, white transition metal valued for its electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. \nSterling silver only contains 92.5% silver. The rest is usually made up of copper or some \nother metal. is platinum a metal? Platinum is a lustrous, malleable, silvery-white, ductile \nmetal. It is considered one of the transition metals, a group that includes silver, gold, titanium \nand copper. is sterling silver stronger than white gold? Sterling silver is less durable than \nwhite gold, which usually comes with a higher price tag. what's the difference between \nplatinum and stainless steel jewelry? Stainless steel resists wear, dings, dents and scratches \nbetter than platinum. That said, while modern stainless steel jewelry can be very attractive, \nplatinum jewelry still maintains a superior visual appeal and a higher monetary value. which \nis stronger titanium or platinum? When it comes to durability, titanium is much harder than \nplatinum. It doesn't scratch, damage or easily lose its shape. --> schedule an appointment \nSchedule an appointment online or in person to discuss more about moissanite stones and \nsee Helzberg's selection of moissanite rings and jewelry today!

The short answer is no, you \nshould not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re here to help you \ndecide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of damage or an \nunfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your engagement ring \nevery day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their rings every chance \nthey get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special times when you \nreally want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond engagement ring \ndoesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation starter. Your new ring is \nan eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing implications. It&rsquo;s only \nnatural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story behind it. Proudly show off \nyour ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. Do: A night out Gearing up for \na night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with your engagement ring. The \nbrilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any outfit, from casual ensembles to \nelegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate date night or attending a \nblack-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that will help you stand out. \nWhen not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances when it&rsquo;s better to \nstore your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When you&rsquo;re working up a sweat, \nyou risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. You&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to \npotential abrasions from weights and gym equipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool \nchlorine are other potential hazards found in many fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or \ncooking Cooking and food prep pose a major risk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products \ncould become lodged in the ring setting, and your ring could slip off when you rinse \nsomething off in the sink. When to think twice about wearing your engagement ring \nSometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear your engagement ring isn&rsquo;t \nstraightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to weigh the pros and cons to help you \ndecide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at home. It depends: At work If sitting \nat a computer and typing up emails, reports and presentations sounds like part of your \nworkday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. On the other hand, if you're a \nmechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, you get the idea), it&rsquo;s \nbest to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: Traveling Should you travel with \nyour engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For short trips that pose little risk, you \ncan probably get away with wearing your ring most of the time. You can wear jewelry while \ngoing through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing them in a carry-on bag. Before \nmaking a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the potential risks &mdash; where \nyou&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during your stay. If you're on a \ntropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose your ring while \nswimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if it&rsquo;s really \nworth taking a chance on something so close to your heart.

Read on to learn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right \nstone for your budget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal \nfire, sparkle and brilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel \noverwhelming. While everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what \nmakes one diamond superior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. \nwhat are the 4cs of diamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for \nassessing the excellence of any diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, \ncolor, clarity and carat weight work to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are \nhow gemologists measure diamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry \nand proportions of the diamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A \nskilled cutter uses precise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers \nmaximum visual effects, including brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the \nscattering of light into each color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of \nlight produced by reflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends \non the quality of a diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond \nreaches the hands of a diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A \nwell-cut diamond will appear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear \ndark and dull. types of diamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes \nthrough the side of the stone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of \nthe stone before it can be reflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces \n— or facets — represents the quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall \nbrilliance. With well-proportioned cuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back \nthrough the top of the diamond. Superior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut \nDiamond Each grading lab uses their own grading scale and terminology to determine a \ndiamond's cut, based on the level of precision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color \nAlmost any naturally occurring diamond has some amount of color. How much determines \nthe quality of the diamond. While there are colorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. \nAnytime you purchase a diamond, you should expect it to have at least some trace amount \nof natural color. what is diamond color? Natural diamonds are the product of geological \nprocesses that take billions of years to complete. The chemical and physical processes yield \na wide array of stones which all include some varying amounts of color. In most instances, \nthe less color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond \nbuyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality based on the amount of color present within \nthe stone. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for \nthe amount of natural color they contain. Most diamond buyers prefer colorless to \nnear-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and J offering optimal value for a customer's \nbudget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds have little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to \nthe stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop of pure water. Because they are so rare, \ncolorless diamonds are often the most valuable. Near Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless \ndiamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint that is difficult to see with the naked eye. \nThese stones make up only 2–3 percent of all natural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often \nthe best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in the middle of the diamond color chart. \nUnmounted faint diamonds often have a faint yellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked \neye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer great value, as the color is often difficult to see \nwith the untrained eye, unless compared right next to a stone in the near-colorless or \ncolorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond contains small blemishes (external) and \ninclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The fewer imperfections a diamond has, the more \nvaluable it is. The more imperfections a diamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is \ndiamond clarity? This describes the internal and external characteristics of a diamond. A \ngrade is assigned to each stone, with \"IF\" referring to a diamond with inclusions and \"FL\" \nreferencing flawless clarity. Diamond buyers will choose stones with some inclusions to offer \n\nthe best value to their customers. At Helzberg, we offer a variety of diamond clarities sure to \nfit any budget. diamond clarity grades Diamond clarity grades are measured by the amount \nof inclusions, or imperfections, in a stone. The below table provides definitions for each of the \ncommon diamond clarity grades, so you can thoughtfully consider how visible imperfections \nwill be. diamond clarity chart FL, IF These are flawless diamonds, no matter how closely you \nlook. Flawless and internally flawless are the highest, and rarest, diamond quality clarity \ngrades. vvs1, vvs2 These diamonds have very slight inclusions, visible only under a \nmicroscope. These inclusions are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see. vs1, vs2 \nThese are very slightly included, difficult to see with the naked eye and somewhat difficult to \nsee under a microscope. si1, si2 These imperfections can be seen by the trained eye under \n10x magnification. They might still be visible to the naked eye, but harder to see in diamonds \nsmaller than 1 carat. i1, i2, i3 These inclusions are very easy for a trained eye to see under \n10x magnification. They are also often visible to the naked eye, and in the case of I3 \ndiamonds, the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the diamond as well as impact \nits brilliance. diamond carat weight When most people think about diamond quality, their \nminds immediately focus on carat weight. While other factors are also important, carat weight \nis one of the most significant characteristics in determining a diamond's quality and price. \nwhat is a diamond carat? This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The larger \nthe carat, the pricier the diamond, although the other Cs can also work to influence the final \nprice. diamond carat chart Diamonds are available in a variety of sizes, but the most \ncommon diamond sizes range from .25 to 5 carats.

Rules, after all, are meant to be broken, and there are many alternative \nengagement rings that may better fit their personality, desires &hellip; and your budget. Here \nare a few of the many non-traditional engagement rings that will last for a lifetime of \ntogetherness. Alternative To What? Traditional engagement rings typically involve some sort \nof diamond taking center stage &mdash; like a solitaire diamond ring with a platinum setting \nor a larger carat cushion cut diamond surrounded by a halo of smaller stones. Those classic \nstyles definitely transcend trends, but they also often come at price points outside your \nbudget. Alternative options give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to colors, styles and \nprices. Plus, choosing an alternative metal, stone or style allows you to flex your creativity to \ncreate a more personalized custom engagement ring. Types Of Alternative Engagement \nRings The good news is the options are virtually endless when creating a meaningful \nalternative ring. (Psst: It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a ring. You can give an engagement \nnecklace, watch or earrings if that&rsquo;s more your speed!) With that in mind, here are a \nfew alternative options you may not have thought of when you begin your search for the \nperfect engagement ring: Moissanite Engagement Rings If the wow factor of a large natural \ndiamond doesn&rsquo;t mesh with your budget, consider going the moissanite route. This \nsuper hard, scratch-resistant stone gives the look and brilliance of a diamond without the \ncost. That means you can buy a much larger stone with a much smaller price tag. morganite \nengagement rings Her wedding colors don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;blush and \nbashful&rdquo; (name that movie!) to love the delicate pink tint of a morganite gemstone. \nChoose a simple pear-shaped gem with a rose gold band for a monochromatic masterpiece, \nor up the glam factor with a romantic diamond halo surrounding an oval-shaped center \nstone. sapphire engagement rings Are you Team Diana, Team Kate Middleton or somewhere \nin between? If so, consider the royal aesthetic and centuries-old beauty of a sapphire. This \nblue gemstone is great for daily wear owing to its durability, and you can go with a single \nstone on a gold band, make it flashier with surrounding diamonds or white sapphires, or \nchoose a sapphire band with inset stones. If you want a bright pink gemstone that&rsquo;s \nmore vibrant than morganite, select a unique pink sapphire. ruby engagement rings Let the \nfiery passion of your relationship match the center stone of a ruby engagement ring. Choose \na round cut ruby gemstone surrounded by a halo of moissanite gemstones for a deeply \nromantic piece of jewelry. The deep red gives the piece a unique touch that will stand out on \ntheir finger. amethyst engagement rings If you don&rsquo;t go the traditional route, consider \nchoosing a ring that commemorates a February birthday. The deep purple hue of amethyst \npromises a dreamy mystique while incorporating a bit of personalization into the ring. Select \nan opulent design with a rose gold metal to really accentuate the amethyst tone. topaz \nengagement rings Looking for a vintage non-traditional engagement ring? A rich blue topaz \nring gives the look of something old while serving as their &ldquo;something blue.&rdquo; \nSelect a stunning Art Deco-style ring featuring a large, sparkling topaz stunner that promises \nthe wow-factor she craves. aquamarine engagement rings Capture the tranquility of the \nocean or the gentleness of her spirit with the quiet brilliance of an aquamarine ring. Choose \nfrom a range of shapes, sizes and settings, whether she prefers the look of an emerald-cut \nstone surrounded by diamonds in a white gold setting or a vintage-style setting featuring a \npear-shaped aquamarine. stacking band engagement rings If your bride-to-be prefers a \nmore delicate style, go with the look of a single band, whether a plain yellow or white gold \nring, or something with a row of diamonds or gemstones. A single band speaks to classic \nsimplicity, perfect for the minimalist bride who loves clean lines and understated elegance. \nAdd extra bands over time, whether for an anniversary, the birth of a child, a special \noccasion or a holiday. Or plan to propose with three stacked bands that coordinate with her \nsophisticated style. completely unique engagement rings Anything can be an engagement \nring &mdash; a paperclip, a gumball machine treasure, a birthstone band, even a thicker \nmen&rsquo;s wedding band, if that&rsquo;s more their speed. Whatever ring you select will \n\nhave its own special meaning for all of eternity. Design Your Own One-Of-A-Kind Engagment \nRing Can&rsquo;t find a ring that fulfills all of her desires? Make your own! Designing a \ncustom engagement ring will give you the chance to flex some creativity while ensuring you \nfind exactly what you want.

Rules, after all, are meant to be broken, and there are many alternative \nengagement rings that may better fit their personality, desires &hellip; and your budget. Here \nare a few of the many non-traditional engagement rings that will last for a lifetime of \ntogetherness. Alternative To What? Traditional engagement rings typically involve some sort \nof diamond taking center stage &mdash; like a solitaire diamond ring with a platinum setting \nor a larger carat cushion cut diamond surrounded by a halo of smaller stones. Those classic \nstyles definitely transcend trends, but they also often come at price points outside your \nbudget. Alternative options give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to colors, styles and \nprices. Plus, choosing an alternative metal, stone or style allows you to flex your creativity to \ncreate a more personalized custom engagement ring. Types Of Alternative Engagement \nRings The good news is the options are virtually endless when creating a meaningful \nalternative ring. (Psst: It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a ring. You can give an engagement \nnecklace, watch or earrings if that&rsquo;s more your speed!) With that in mind, here are a \nfew alternative options you may not have thought of when you begin your search for the \nperfect engagement ring: Moissanite Engagement Rings If the wow factor of a large natural \ndiamond doesn&rsquo;t mesh with your budget, consider going the moissanite route. This \nsuper hard, scratch-resistant stone gives the look and brilliance of a diamond without the \ncost. That means you can buy a much larger stone with a much smaller price tag. morganite \nengagement rings Her wedding colors don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;blush and \nbashful&rdquo; (name that movie!) to love the delicate pink tint of a morganite gemstone. \nChoose a simple pear-shaped gem with a rose gold band for a monochromatic masterpiece, \nor up the glam factor with a romantic diamond halo surrounding an oval-shaped center \nstone. sapphire engagement rings Are you Team Diana, Team Kate Middleton or somewhere \nin between? If so, consider the royal aesthetic and centuries-old beauty of a sapphire. This \nblue gemstone is great for daily wear owing to its durability, and you can go with a single \nstone on a gold band, make it flashier with surrounding diamonds or white sapphires, or \nchoose a sapphire band with inset stones. If you want a bright pink gemstone that&rsquo;s \nmore vibrant than morganite, select a unique pink sapphire. ruby engagement rings Let the \nfiery passion of your relationship match the center stone of a ruby engagement ring. Choose \na round cut ruby gemstone surrounded by a halo of moissanite gemstones for a deeply \nromantic piece of jewelry. The deep red gives the piece a unique touch that will stand out on \ntheir finger. amethyst engagement rings If you don&rsquo;t go the traditional route, consider \nchoosing a ring that commemorates a February birthday. The deep purple hue of amethyst \npromises a dreamy mystique while incorporating a bit of personalization into the ring. Select \nan opulent design with a rose gold metal to really accentuate the amethyst tone. topaz \nengagement rings Looking for a vintage non-traditional engagement ring? A rich blue topaz \nring gives the look of something old while serving as their &ldquo;something blue.&rdquo; \nSelect a stunning Art Deco-style ring featuring a large, sparkling topaz stunner that promises \nthe wow-factor she craves. aquamarine engagement rings Capture the tranquility of the \nocean or the gentleness of her spirit with the quiet brilliance of an aquamarine ring. Choose \nfrom a range of shapes, sizes and settings, whether she prefers the look of an emerald-cut \nstone surrounded by diamonds in a white gold setting or a vintage-style setting featuring a \npear-shaped aquamarine. stacking band engagement rings If your bride-to-be prefers a \nmore delicate style, go with the look of a single band, whether a plain yellow or white gold \nring, or something with a row of diamonds or gemstones. A single band speaks to classic \nsimplicity, perfect for the minimalist bride who loves clean lines and understated elegance. \nAdd extra bands over time, whether for an anniversary, the birth of a child, a special \noccasion or a holiday. Or plan to propose with three stacked bands that coordinate with her \nsophisticated style. completely unique engagement rings Anything can be an engagement \nring &mdash; a paperclip, a gumball machine treasure, a birthstone band, even a thicker \nmen&rsquo;s wedding band, if that&rsquo;s more their speed. Whatever ring you select will \n\nhave its own special meaning for all of eternity. Design Your Own One-Of-A-Kind Engagment \nRing Can&rsquo;t find a ring that fulfills all of her desires? Make your own! Designing a \ncustom engagement ring will give you the chance to flex some creativity while ensuring you \nfind exactly what you want.

But if you prefer \nsomething different, there are plenty of other shapes available to reflect your unique style \nand taste. what is a diamond shape? Diamonds can be cut into a variety of shapes. There’s \nan option for every bride and budget! Since every diamond shape is cut to varying \nspecifications, they will reflect light differently, giving every shape its own brilliance and fire. \ntypes of diamond shapes round cut diamonds The most popular shape of all time: the round \nbrilliant diamond. Aside from being the most iconic diamond shape, the round diamond is \nmost loved because of its ability to sparkle brighter than any other shape. Because round \ndiamonds are the most popular and most researched shape, they offer the greatest amount \nof flexibility in terms of balancing cut, color, clarity grade and price. Shop round cut diamonds \nprincess cut diamonds The princess cut diamond has a square shape with sharp angles and \na similar facet pattern as the round brilliant diamond, so it sparkles more than other square \nshapes. Sophisticated and eye-catching, the princess cut is perfect for those who love \nsymmetry, clean lines and modern design. Shop princess cut diamonds cushion cut \ndiamonds A cushion cut diamond is a square or rectangular shape with rounded corners, \nlike a cross between a round and a princess cut diamond. A cushion diamond has a soft, \n\nromantic appeal and is sometimes known as a pillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds \nemerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut diamond has the same number of facets as \nround and princess cut diamonds, it is the parallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color \nand clarity. The best way to describe the emerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a \nlarge table and step-cut faceting that creates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric \ndiamond shape is rare: only 3 percent of all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut \ndiamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval cut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated \nsilhouette to appear larger. A brilliant facet pattern means the diamond sparkles as well as a \nround or princess cut, and the exquisite oval shape appeals to any bride, whether she \nprefers classic or more modern looks. Shop oval cut diamonds marquise cut diamonds The \nmarquise shape is an elongated oval with pointed ends and is sometimes referred to as boat \nshaped. The elongated shape maximizes the carat weight of the diamond. Plus, this cut \ncreates the illusion of a larger diamond. Shop marquise cut diamonds pear cut diamonds \nThe pear-shaped diamond can appear modern or vintage, depending on its setting. Its \nelongated teardrop has a narrow pointed top and perfectly rounded bottom. The brilliant cut \nis known for high sparkle, and the elegant pear shape helps to lengthen and flatter its \nwearer's finger. Shop pear cut diamonds radiant cut diamonds Radiant cut diamonds have a \nrectangular shape with cropped corners. The square stone is cut to have a complete \nbrilliant-cut facet pattern. A radiant diamond is also available in a more rectangular shape, \ndepending on its length-to-width ratio. Radiant cut diamond engagement rings are beloved \nfor the sparkle they produce and are usually set in a prong-style solitaire setting. Shop \nradiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon shape has cropped corners and \nmesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. The Asscher, developed during \nthe Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald cut. The Asscher is most \nwell-known for its X-shaped facets that can be seen from above. The Asscher cut is \ncommonly referred to as being “vintage” or “antique.” Shop asscher cut diamonds heart cut \ndiamonds Wear your love loud and proud with a bold symbol of romance: a heart-shaped \ndiamond. Whimsical and sweet, a heart-shaped diamond is just what it sounds like: a \nstunning stone carefully cut into the shape of a heart. how are diamonds cut into shapes? \nDiamond cutting is essentially done by either cleaning or sawing a diamond with a laser or \nsteel blade. There are many other key steps involved in the process, and it takes skilled \nhands to ensure that a diamond is faceted to high standards. frequently asked questions \nWhat Is the Difference Between Diamond Shape and Diamond Cut? The shape of a \ndiamond refers to the external figure or outline of the diamond (pear-shaped, cushion, \nround). The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most? Reflected by their \nwidespread popularity, round diamonds are the pinnacle in brilliance. Most commonly cut \nwith 58 facets that reflect light, round brilliant diamonds are nearly unmatched when it comes \nto shine. How Does Diamond Shape Affect the Price of a Ring? A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size. Because fancy \nshapes, such as pear, oval and marquise, are elongated, they tend to look larger than round \ndiamonds. Which Diamond Shapes Are the Largest? Marquise diamonds have the largest \nface-up area of any diamond cut — approximately 15 percent larger than round diamonds. \nThey also cost less than round diamonds of the same carat. schedule an appointment Not \nsure what diamond shape is best for your partner's future engagement ring?

Diamond \n\ngrading reports, based on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide \nbuyers with assurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have \nbeen graded by some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® \nand GCAL. For every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, \nwhich assesses a stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading \nreport? Diamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at \nindependent grading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on \nimportant characteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are \nincluded in a diamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, \nthe grading lab issues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores \nfor each of the fundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity \nand carat weight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. \nThe most common carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide \nvariety of sizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of \nissued grading reports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes \ncan be identified. Diamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports \ninclude proportions diagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to \nthe culet (the small facet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the \namount of natural color present within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a \ngrade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, \nthe less natural color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also \nmeasure a diamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. \nBluish fluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or \nunder fluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar \ncarat weight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond. Helzberg offers detailed \nreports for every graded diamond we sell. With ethical sourcing of our materials and strict \ndiamond quality standards, we go above and beyond industry standards to provide each \ncustomer with the exceptional quality that has defined the Helzberg name for over a century. \nwhy does helzberg use multiple labs? Our approach to fine jewelry is Quality Over \nEverything, which is why we partner with some of the diamond industry’s most trusted, \n\nindependent grading labs. Their sole purpose is to validate diamond quality through detailed \ngrading reports. Though these reports include ratings or scores based on similar \ncharacteristics, the way they are measured differs from lab to lab — and from natural and lab \ngrown diamonds to gemstones. We look to these experts to ensure you get the highest \nquality stone available, no matter which you choose. more advice engagement buying guide \nFinding the perfect engagement ring can be overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.

Then create your own! \nPartner with our jewelry experts to select your center stone and setting, then have it come to \n\nlife with expert craftsmanship and quality. Get started What is an engagement ring setting? \nThe term &ldquo;setting&rdquo; refers to how a gem is mounted, or set, into a precious \nmetal band. Ideally, an engagement ring's setting should showcase the beauty of the \ngemstone while reflecting the unique personality of the wearer. In addition to determining \nhow the engagement ring will look, the setting will help determine what kind of diamond or \ngemstone you will buy. Channel-set ring Channel settings do not include beads, prongs or \nany fixtures in between the stones. Instead, the gems are set adjacent to each other with \nonly the minimum amount of space separating them. This row of closely set diamonds is \nsecured in place by metal bars on either side. Channel-set diamonds are known for their \ncontinuous sparkle all the way around the ring band. Cathedral setting ring The -->cathedral \nsetting--> features a center gemstone flanked by metal arches that rise from the shank. This \nelevated profile secures the stone in place, while giving it a very distinct profile. It also \ncreates what looks similar to a basket on the underside of the engagement ring. The setting \nis reminiscent of the lovely arches in ceilings and doorways of Gothic-style cathedrals. \nDiamond prong setting types Prong choice is a very important part of the ring selection \nprocess. Strong prongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter \nyour diamond or other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or \nsix prongs evenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- \nand six-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring. Helzberg sells \nsettings without the stone in stores, but not online. find a store How long does it take to set \nan engagement ring?

Unfortunately, improper care can shorten the life of your \npiece and diminish its beauty. Here’s a quick guide to help keep your fine jewelry looking as \ngood as the day you bought it for many years to come. --> jewelry care From regular \ncleaning to smart storage, a lot goes into preserving the look and durability of gems, \nprecious metals and the craftsmanship that holds them all together. While periodic cleaning \ncan help keep your jewelry looking great, you can also help preserve its luster by taking a \nhands-off approach. When you handle your jewelry, the oils from your fingers can diminish its \nappearance. When possible, try to limit how often you handle your jewelry to reduce the \nneed for cleaning. When getting ready for the workday or a fun night on the town, it's always \nbest to put your rings, bracelets and necklaces on last. This will help prevent makeup from \nsticking to your jewelry and keep gems from snagging on clothing and loosening from their \nsettings. You should also familiarize yourself with some fundamental concepts to help you \ncare for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions While it's important to know how to \nproperly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to know what not to do. For regular \ncleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean polishing cloth and specially made \ngem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, ordinary degreasing dish soap is \nthe safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid harsh cleansers and don’t use hot \nwater. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive household cleaners to clean \njewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage many precious gems and \nmetals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot water. Try to limit how \nmuch you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this can cause the color to \nfade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious stones. how to store jewelry \nProper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or tarnished over time. It’s \nimportant to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the tarnishing process. Use a \ndehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep your jewelry out in the \nopen. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store different types of jewelry \nseparately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's best to store your diamond \npieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer gems. You can also wrap \nyour diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage. To best extend the life of your \nmost-loved pieces, we recommend a Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan, which covers inspections \nand repairs on your jewelry purchases. --> --> schedule an appointment Learn about \nHelzberg’s Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan and discover all the jewelry we have to offer.

For example, we set our engagement rings in gold or \nplatinum so your ring will last for years and years. Diamond fashion jewelry, on the other \nhand, is most commonly set in gold, while silver is used to give you a large look at a great \nprice. Of course, there are many types of jewelry metals out there for both women's and \nmen's jewelry alike. Our quick guide to understanding metal types is here to help sort them \nall out. Let's dive in! types of jewelry metals Some of the most common metal types used to \nmake jewelry are gold, silver and platinum. Others include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, \npalladium, cobalt, stainless steel and so many others. Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \n\npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal.

After a while, your engagement ring can start to feel like part of your body. \nIt only makes sense that you would experience a little separation anxiety when it&rsquo;s \nnot on your finger. But should you wear your engagement ring everywhere? The short \nanswer is no, you should not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re \nhere to help you decide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of \ndamage or an unfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your \nengagement ring every day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their \nrings every chance they get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special \ntimes when you really want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond \nengagement ring doesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation \nstarter. Your new ring is an eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing \nimplications. It&rsquo;s only natural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story \nbehind it. Proudly show off your ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. \nDo: A night out Gearing up for a night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with \nyour engagement ring. The brilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any \noutfit, from casual ensembles to elegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate \ndate night or attending a black-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that \nwill help you stand out. When not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances \nwhen it&rsquo;s better to store your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When \nyou&rsquo;re working up a sweat, you risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. \nYou&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to potential abrasions from weights and gym \nequipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool chlorine are other potential hazards found in \nmany fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or cooking Cooking and food prep pose a major \nrisk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products could become lodged in the ring setting, and \nyour ring could slip off when you rinse something off in the sink. When to think twice about \nwearing your engagement ring Sometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear \nyour engagement ring isn&rsquo;t straightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to \nweigh the pros and cons to help you decide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at \nhome. It depends: At work If sitting at a computer and typing up emails, reports and \npresentations sounds like part of your workday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. \nOn the other hand, if you're a mechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, \nyou get the idea), it&rsquo;s best to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: \nTraveling Should you travel with your engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For \nshort trips that pose little risk, you can probably get away with wearing your ring most of the \ntime. You can wear jewelry while going through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing \nthem in a carry-on bag. Before making a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the \npotential risks &mdash; where you&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during \nyour stay. If you're on a tropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose \nyour ring while swimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if \nit&rsquo;s really worth taking a chance on something so close to your heart.

Read on to \nlearn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right stone for your \nbudget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal fire, sparkle and \nbrilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel overwhelming. \nWhile everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what makes one diamond \nsuperior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. what are the 4cs of \ndiamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for assessing the excellence of \nany diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, color, clarity and carat weight \nwork to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are how gemologists measure \ndiamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry and proportions of the \ndiamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A skilled cutter uses \nprecise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers maximum visual effects, \nincluding brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the scattering of light into \neach color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of light produced by \nreflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends on the quality of \na diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond reaches the hands of \na diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A well-cut diamond will \nappear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear dark and dull. types of \ndiamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes through the side of the \nstone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of the stone before it can be \nreflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces — or facets — represents \nthe quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall brilliance. With well-proportioned \ncuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back through the top of the diamond. \nSuperior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut Diamond Each grading lab uses their \nown grading scale and terminology to determine a diamond's cut, based on the level of \nprecision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color Almost any naturally occurring diamond \nhas some amount of color. How much determines the quality of the diamond. While there are \ncolorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. Anytime you purchase a diamond, you \nshould expect it to have at least some trace amount of natural color. what is diamond color? \nNatural diamonds are the product of geological processes that take billions of years to \ncomplete. The chemical and physical processes yield a wide array of stones which all include \nsome varying amounts of color. In most instances, the less color a diamond has, the higher \nits quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond buyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality \nbased on the amount of color present within the stone. From white to yellow, diamonds \nreceive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. \nMost diamond buyers prefer colorless to near-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and \nJ offering optimal value for a customer's budget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds \nhave little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to the stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop \nof pure water. Because they are so rare, colorless diamonds are often the most valuable. \nNear Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless diamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint \nthat is difficult to see with the naked eye. These stones make up only 2–3 percent of all \nnatural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often the best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in \nthe middle of the diamond color chart. Unmounted faint diamonds often have a faint \nyellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked eye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer \ngreat value, as the color is often difficult to see with the untrained eye, unless compared right \nnext to a stone in the near-colorless or colorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond \ncontains small blemishes (external) and inclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The \nfewer imperfections a diamond has, the more valuable it is. The more imperfections a \ndiamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is diamond clarity?

But if you prefer something different, there are plenty of other shapes \navailable to reflect your unique style and taste. what is a diamond shape? Diamonds can be \ncut into a variety of shapes. There’s an option for every bride and budget! Since every \ndiamond shape is cut to varying specifications, they will reflect light differently, giving every \nshape its own brilliance and fire. types of diamond shapes round cut diamonds The most \npopular shape of all time: the round brilliant diamond. Aside from being the most iconic \ndiamond shape, the round diamond is most loved because of its ability to sparkle brighter \nthan any other shape. Because round diamonds are the most popular and most researched \nshape, they offer the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of balancing cut, color, clarity \ngrade and price. Shop round cut diamonds princess cut diamonds The princess cut diamond \nhas a square shape with sharp angles and a similar facet pattern as the round brilliant \ndiamond, so it sparkles more than other square shapes. Sophisticated and eye-catching, the \nprincess cut is perfect for those who love symmetry, clean lines and modern design. Shop \nprincess cut diamonds cushion cut diamonds A cushion cut diamond is a square or \nrectangular shape with rounded corners, like a cross between a round and a princess cut \ndiamond. A cushion diamond has a soft, romantic appeal and is sometimes known as a \npillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds emerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut \ndiamond has the same number of facets as round and princess cut diamonds, it is the \nparallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color and clarity. The best way to describe the \nemerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a large table and step-cut faceting that \ncreates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric diamond shape is rare: only 3 percent \nof all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut diamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval \ncut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated silhouette to appear larger.

Shop radiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon \nshape has cropped corners and mesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. \nThe Asscher, developed during the Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald \ncut.

Diamond cutting is essentially done by either cleaning or sawing a diamond \nwith a laser or steel blade. There are many other key steps involved in the process, and it \ntakes skilled hands to ensure that a diamond is faceted to high standards. frequently asked \nquestions What Is the Difference Between Diamond Shape and Diamond Cut? The shape of \na diamond refers to the external figure or outline of the diamond (pear-shaped, cushion, \nround). The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most?

A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size.

Diamond grading reports, \nbased on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide buyers with \nassurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have been graded \nby some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® and GCAL. \nFor every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, which assesses \na stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading report? \nDiamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at independent \ngrading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on important \ncharacteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are included in a \ndiamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, the grading lab \nissues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores for each of the \nfundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity and carat \nweight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The most \ncommon carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide variety of \nsizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of issued grading \nreports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes can be identified. \nDiamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports include proportions \ndiagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to the culet (the small \nfacet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the amount of natural color \npresent within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D \n(colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, the less natural \ncolor a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also measure a \ndiamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. Bluish \nfluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or under \nfluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar carat \nweight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond. Helzberg offers detailed \nreports for every graded diamond we sell. With ethical sourcing of our materials and strict \ndiamond quality standards, we go above and beyond industry standards to provide each \ncustomer with the exceptional quality that has defined the Helzberg name for over a century. \n\nwhy does helzberg use multiple labs?

Partner with our \njewelry experts to select your center stone and setting, then have it come to life with expert \ncraftsmanship and quality. Get started What is an engagement ring setting? The term \n&ldquo;setting&rdquo; refers to how a gem is mounted, or set, into a precious metal band. \nIdeally, an engagement ring's setting should showcase the beauty of the gemstone while \nreflecting the unique personality of the wearer. In addition to determining how the \nengagement ring will look, the setting will help determine what kind of diamond or gemstone \nyou will buy. Channel-set ring Channel settings do not include beads, prongs or any fixtures \nin between the stones. Instead, the gems are set adjacent to each other with only the \nminimum amount of space separating them. This row of closely set diamonds is secured in \nplace by metal bars on either side. Channel-set diamonds are known for their continuous \nsparkle all the way around the ring band. Cathedral setting ring The -->cathedral setting--> \nfeatures a center gemstone flanked by metal arches that rise from the shank. This elevated \nprofile secures the stone in place, while giving it a very distinct profile. It also creates what \nlooks similar to a basket on the underside of the engagement ring. The setting is reminiscent \nof the lovely arches in ceilings and doorways of Gothic-style cathedrals. Diamond prong \nsetting types Prong choice is a very important part of the ring selection process. Strong \nprongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter your diamond \nor other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or six prongs \nevenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- and \nsix-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \n\naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring.

You should also familiarize yourself with some \nfundamental concepts to help you care for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions \nWhile it's important to know how to properly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to \nknow what not to do. For regular cleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean \npolishing cloth and specially made gem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, \nordinary degreasing dish soap is the safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid \nharsh cleansers and don’t use hot water. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive \nhousehold cleaners to clean jewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage \nmany precious gems and metals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot \nwater. Try to limit how much you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this \ncan cause the color to fade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious \nstones. how to store jewelry Proper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or \ntarnished over time. It’s important to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the \ntarnishing process. Use a dehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep \nyour jewelry out in the open. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store \ndifferent types of jewelry separately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's \nbest to store your diamond pieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer \ngems. You can also wrap your diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage. To \nbest extend the life of your most-loved pieces, we recommend a Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan, \nwhich covers inspections and repairs on your jewelry purchases. --> --> schedule an \nappointment Learn about Helzberg’s Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan and discover all the jewelry \nwe have to offer.

For example, we set our engagement rings in gold or \nplatinum so your ring will last for years and years. Diamond fashion jewelry, on the other \nhand, is most commonly set in gold, while silver is used to give you a large look at a great \nprice. Of course, there are many types of jewelry metals out there for both women's and \nmen's jewelry alike. Our quick guide to understanding metal types is here to help sort them \nall out. Let's dive in! types of jewelry metals Some of the most common metal types used to \nmake jewelry are gold, silver and platinum. Others include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, \npalladium, cobalt, stainless steel and so many others. Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \n\nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal. While \nmost black titanium in the market is plated, Helzberg only offers Benchmark black titanium, a \ntrue black metal titanium that gets its beautiful look from a proprietary alloying and heating \nprocess. Shop titanium jewelry stainless steel Stainless steel is a metal composed of iron \nalloy and a minimum of 10.5% of chromium. The chromium makes the metal resistant to \nstaining, corroding and oxidation. Stainless steel comes in many grades, meaning it has a \nvariety of uses — including jewelry! This hard, durable and affordable metal is most \ncommonly available in an attractive light gray, making it an appealing metal for men's jewelry. \nShop stainless steel jewelry cobalt Often called cobalt chrome, this metal is an excellent \nchoice for men's wedding bands. With its beautiful luster and high durability, cobalt looks \nsimilar to white gold and is a long-lasting choice that will maintain its beauty for years to \ncome. Shop cobalt jewelry zirconium Often confused with titanium, zirconium is a refractive \nmetal commonly used in industrial applications and, more recently, in jewelry. In its natural \nstate, the metal is a silvery gray, but it attains a black appearance after a heating process. A \ndurable, lustrous metal, black zirconium is a bold and handsome metal option. Shop \nzirconium jewelry elysium To create an elysium ring, thousands of diamonds are fused \ntogether with incredible heat under one million pounds of pressure. This creates a 100% \ndiamond piece that's extremely lightweight, hypoallergenic and comfortable. Known for its \nsignature black color, elysium jewelry requires no special care and will never dull, fade, \nscratch or change color. Elysium rings are the hardest and most scratch-resistant rings on \nthe planet and cannot be resized by a jeweler. Shop elysium jewelry damascus steel Named \nfor the capital city of Syria, Damascus steel refers to the forged wootz crucible steel used in \nthe creation of blades and swords from ancient times. Made using iron alloys, modern \nDamascus steel jewelry is crafted by placing contrasting metals of various shades (often \ngray and silver) in layers. These layers are then bonded using high heat and shaped by a \ncomplicated and artistic process resulting in beautiful patterns. Shop damascus steel jewelry \nmeteorite A meteorite is a chunk of debris from a meteoroid originating from outer space. \nMeteorite jewelry is usually made from iron meteorites. While there are all sorts of iron \nmeteorites, some are more common than others, including Gibeon meteorite. A very \ncompelling material for one-of-a-kind men's wedding bands, meteorite is an incredibly rare \nmaterial billions of years in the making. Because it is exceptionally rare, meteorite jewelry is \nexpensive. It also requires extra care due to its high iron content which leaves it susceptible \nto rust. Shop meteorite jewelry frequently asked questions is silver a metal? Silver is a soft, \nlustrous, white transition metal valued for its electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. \nSterling silver only contains 92.5% silver. The rest is usually made up of copper or some \nother metal. is platinum a metal? Platinum is a lustrous, malleable, silvery-white, ductile \nmetal. It is considered one of the transition metals, a group that includes silver, gold, titanium \nand copper. is sterling silver stronger than white gold? Sterling silver is less durable than \nwhite gold, which usually comes with a higher price tag. what's the difference between \nplatinum and stainless steel jewelry? Stainless steel resists wear, dings, dents and scratches \nbetter than platinum. That said, while modern stainless steel jewelry can be very attractive, \nplatinum jewelry still maintains a superior visual appeal and a higher monetary value. which \nis stronger titanium or platinum? When it comes to durability, titanium is much harder than \nplatinum. It doesn't scratch, damage or easily lose its shape. --> schedule an appointment \nSchedule an appointment online or in person to discuss more about moissanite stones and \nsee Helzberg's selection of moissanite rings and jewelry today!

It only makes \nsense that you would experience a little separation anxiety when it&rsquo;s not on your \nfinger. But should you wear your engagement ring everywhere? The short answer is no, you \nshould not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re here to help you \ndecide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of damage or an \nunfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your engagement ring \nevery day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their rings every chance \nthey get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special times when you \nreally want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond engagement ring \ndoesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation starter. Your new ring is \nan eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing implications. It&rsquo;s only \nnatural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story behind it. Proudly show off \nyour ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. Do: A night out Gearing up for \na night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with your engagement ring. The \nbrilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any outfit, from casual ensembles to \nelegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate date night or attending a \nblack-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that will help you stand out. \nWhen not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances when it&rsquo;s better to \nstore your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When you&rsquo;re working up a sweat, \nyou risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. You&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to \npotential abrasions from weights and gym equipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool \nchlorine are other potential hazards found in many fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or \ncooking Cooking and food prep pose a major risk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products \ncould become lodged in the ring setting, and your ring could slip off when you rinse \nsomething off in the sink. When to think twice about wearing your engagement ring \nSometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear your engagement ring isn&rsquo;t \nstraightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to weigh the pros and cons to help you \ndecide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at home. It depends: At work If sitting \nat a computer and typing up emails, reports and presentations sounds like part of your \nworkday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. On the other hand, if you're a \nmechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, you get the idea), it&rsquo;s \nbest to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: Traveling Should you travel with \nyour engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For short trips that pose little risk, you \ncan probably get away with wearing your ring most of the time. You can wear jewelry while \ngoing through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing them in a carry-on bag. Before \nmaking a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the potential risks &mdash; where \nyou&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during your stay. If you're on a \ntropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose your ring while \nswimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if it&rsquo;s really \nworth taking a chance on something so close to your heart.

Read on to learn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right \nstone for your budget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal \nfire, sparkle and brilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel \noverwhelming. While everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what \nmakes one diamond superior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. \nwhat are the 4cs of diamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for \nassessing the excellence of any diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, \ncolor, clarity and carat weight work to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are \nhow gemologists measure diamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry \nand proportions of the diamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A \nskilled cutter uses precise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers \nmaximum visual effects, including brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the \nscattering of light into each color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of \nlight produced by reflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends \non the quality of a diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond \nreaches the hands of a diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A \nwell-cut diamond will appear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear \ndark and dull. types of diamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes \nthrough the side of the stone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of \nthe stone before it can be reflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces \n— or facets — represents the quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall \nbrilliance. With well-proportioned cuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back \nthrough the top of the diamond. Superior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut \nDiamond Each grading lab uses their own grading scale and terminology to determine a \ndiamond's cut, based on the level of precision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color \nAlmost any naturally occurring diamond has some amount of color. How much determines \nthe quality of the diamond. While there are colorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. \nAnytime you purchase a diamond, you should expect it to have at least some trace amount \nof natural color. what is diamond color? Natural diamonds are the product of geological \nprocesses that take billions of years to complete. The chemical and physical processes yield \na wide array of stones which all include some varying amounts of color. In most instances, \nthe less color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond \nbuyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality based on the amount of color present within \nthe stone. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for \nthe amount of natural color they contain. Most diamond buyers prefer colorless to \nnear-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and J offering optimal value for a customer's \nbudget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds have little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to \nthe stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop of pure water. Because they are so rare, \ncolorless diamonds are often the most valuable. Near Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless \ndiamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint that is difficult to see with the naked eye. \nThese stones make up only 2–3 percent of all natural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often \nthe best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in the middle of the diamond color chart. \nUnmounted faint diamonds often have a faint yellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked \neye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer great value, as the color is often difficult to see \nwith the untrained eye, unless compared right next to a stone in the near-colorless or \ncolorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond contains small blemishes (external) and \ninclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The fewer imperfections a diamond has, the more \nvaluable it is. The more imperfections a diamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is \ndiamond clarity? This describes the internal and external characteristics of a diamond. A \ngrade is assigned to each stone, with \"IF\" referring to a diamond with inclusions and \"FL\" \nreferencing flawless clarity. Diamond buyers will choose stones with some inclusions to offer \n\nthe best value to their customers. At Helzberg, we offer a variety of diamond clarities sure to \nfit any budget. diamond clarity grades Diamond clarity grades are measured by the amount \nof inclusions, or imperfections, in a stone. The below table provides definitions for each of the \ncommon diamond clarity grades, so you can thoughtfully consider how visible imperfections \nwill be. diamond clarity chart FL, IF These are flawless diamonds, no matter how closely you \nlook. Flawless and internally flawless are the highest, and rarest, diamond quality clarity \ngrades. vvs1, vvs2 These diamonds have very slight inclusions, visible only under a \nmicroscope. These inclusions are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see. vs1, vs2 \nThese are very slightly included, difficult to see with the naked eye and somewhat difficult to \nsee under a microscope. si1, si2 These imperfections can be seen by the trained eye under \n10x magnification. They might still be visible to the naked eye, but harder to see in diamonds \nsmaller than 1 carat. i1, i2, i3 These inclusions are very easy for a trained eye to see under \n10x magnification. They are also often visible to the naked eye, and in the case of I3 \ndiamonds, the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the diamond as well as impact \nits brilliance. diamond carat weight When most people think about diamond quality, their \nminds immediately focus on carat weight. While other factors are also important, carat weight \nis one of the most significant characteristics in determining a diamond's quality and price. \nwhat is a diamond carat? This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The larger \nthe carat, the pricier the diamond, although the other Cs can also work to influence the final \nprice. diamond carat chart Diamonds are available in a variety of sizes, but the most \ncommon diamond sizes range from .25 to 5 carats.

Rules, after all, are meant to be broken, and there are many alternative \nengagement rings that may better fit their personality, desires &hellip; and your budget. Here \nare a few of the many non-traditional engagement rings that will last for a lifetime of \ntogetherness. Alternative To What? Traditional engagement rings typically involve some sort \nof diamond taking center stage &mdash; like a solitaire diamond ring with a platinum setting \nor a larger carat cushion cut diamond surrounded by a halo of smaller stones. Those classic \nstyles definitely transcend trends, but they also often come at price points outside your \nbudget. Alternative options give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to colors, styles and \nprices. Plus, choosing an alternative metal, stone or style allows you to flex your creativity to \ncreate a more personalized custom engagement ring. Types Of Alternative Engagement \nRings The good news is the options are virtually endless when creating a meaningful \nalternative ring. (Psst: It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a ring. You can give an engagement \nnecklace, watch or earrings if that&rsquo;s more your speed!) With that in mind, here are a \nfew alternative options you may not have thought of when you begin your search for the \nperfect engagement ring: Moissanite Engagement Rings If the wow factor of a large natural \ndiamond doesn&rsquo;t mesh with your budget, consider going the moissanite route. This \nsuper hard, scratch-resistant stone gives the look and brilliance of a diamond without the \ncost. That means you can buy a much larger stone with a much smaller price tag. morganite \nengagement rings Her wedding colors don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;blush and \nbashful&rdquo; (name that movie!) to love the delicate pink tint of a morganite gemstone. \nChoose a simple pear-shaped gem with a rose gold band for a monochromatic masterpiece, \nor up the glam factor with a romantic diamond halo surrounding an oval-shaped center \nstone. sapphire engagement rings Are you Team Diana, Team Kate Middleton or somewhere \nin between? If so, consider the royal aesthetic and centuries-old beauty of a sapphire. This \nblue gemstone is great for daily wear owing to its durability, and you can go with a single \nstone on a gold band, make it flashier with surrounding diamonds or white sapphires, or \nchoose a sapphire band with inset stones. If you want a bright pink gemstone that&rsquo;s \nmore vibrant than morganite, select a unique pink sapphire. ruby engagement rings Let the \nfiery passion of your relationship match the center stone of a ruby engagement ring. Choose \na round cut ruby gemstone surrounded by a halo of moissanite gemstones for a deeply \nromantic piece of jewelry. The deep red gives the piece a unique touch that will stand out on \ntheir finger. amethyst engagement rings If you don&rsquo;t go the traditional route, consider \nchoosing a ring that commemorates a February birthday. The deep purple hue of amethyst \npromises a dreamy mystique while incorporating a bit of personalization into the ring. Select \nan opulent design with a rose gold metal to really accentuate the amethyst tone. topaz \nengagement rings Looking for a vintage non-traditional engagement ring? A rich blue topaz \nring gives the look of something old while serving as their &ldquo;something blue.&rdquo; \nSelect a stunning Art Deco-style ring featuring a large, sparkling topaz stunner that promises \nthe wow-factor she craves. aquamarine engagement rings Capture the tranquility of the \nocean or the gentleness of her spirit with the quiet brilliance of an aquamarine ring. Choose \nfrom a range of shapes, sizes and settings, whether she prefers the look of an emerald-cut \nstone surrounded by diamonds in a white gold setting or a vintage-style setting featuring a \npear-shaped aquamarine. stacking band engagement rings If your bride-to-be prefers a \nmore delicate style, go with the look of a single band, whether a plain yellow or white gold \nring, or something with a row of diamonds or gemstones. A single band speaks to classic \nsimplicity, perfect for the minimalist bride who loves clean lines and understated elegance. \nAdd extra bands over time, whether for an anniversary, the birth of a child, a special \noccasion or a holiday. Or plan to propose with three stacked bands that coordinate with her \nsophisticated style. completely unique engagement rings Anything can be an engagement \nring &mdash; a paperclip, a gumball machine treasure, a birthstone band, even a thicker \nmen&rsquo;s wedding band, if that&rsquo;s more their speed. Whatever ring you select will \n\nhave its own special meaning for all of eternity. Design Your Own One-Of-A-Kind Engagment \nRing Can&rsquo;t find a ring that fulfills all of her desires? Make your own! Designing a \ncustom engagement ring will give you the chance to flex some creativity while ensuring you \nfind exactly what you want. You can even get your partner in on the action by going together \nto pick out a stone, select a setting and choose a style. Adding an engraved inscription inside \nthe ring &mdash; whether a wedding date, your initials or a short quotation &mdash; can \nmake it even more unique and meaningful. FAQ's What Makes An Engagement Ring \nAlternative? Anything non-traditional is considered an alternative, meaning the ring \nwon&rsquo;t be your traditional solitaire diamond band. Alternative rings take an unexpected \nmaterial or stray from that traditional diamond into something that better fits with your unique \nstyle. Can I Create My Own Engagement Ring? Absolutely! Your engagement ring should be \na reflection of the wearer and their relationship. Creating your own unique ring is the way to \ngo to ensure that you hit all the must-haves. You can use an online ring tool to virtually build \nand order an engagement ring right from home, or you can work with an in-store jeweler to \nfind your one-of-a-kind masterpiece. What Should I Look For In A Unique Engagement Ring? \nFind an engagement ring that speaks to her personality and style. If she has an affinity for \nmodern and flashy, you might choose a custom morganite ring with a diamond band. If her \nstyle is more pared down and minimalist, a simple band with a few small gemstones may fit \nthe bill. If she wants something completely different, say a thicker silicone band, that works \ntoo!\n\namerican gem society The American Gem Society (AGS) is a non-profit trade association of \njewelers dedicated to setting, maintaining and promoting the highest standards of ethical and \nprofessional behavior through education, accreditation and gemological research.

Rules, after all, are meant to be broken, and there are many alternative \nengagement rings that may better fit their personality, desires &hellip; and your budget. Here \nare a few of the many non-traditional engagement rings that will last for a lifetime of \ntogetherness. Alternative To What? Traditional engagement rings typically involve some sort \nof diamond taking center stage &mdash; like a solitaire diamond ring with a platinum setting \nor a larger carat cushion cut diamond surrounded by a halo of smaller stones. Those classic \nstyles definitely transcend trends, but they also often come at price points outside your \nbudget. Alternative options give you a lot more flexibility when it comes to colors, styles and \nprices. Plus, choosing an alternative metal, stone or style allows you to flex your creativity to \ncreate a more personalized custom engagement ring. Types Of Alternative Engagement \nRings The good news is the options are virtually endless when creating a meaningful \nalternative ring. (Psst: It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be a ring. You can give an engagement \nnecklace, watch or earrings if that&rsquo;s more your speed!) With that in mind, here are a \nfew alternative options you may not have thought of when you begin your search for the \nperfect engagement ring: Moissanite Engagement Rings If the wow factor of a large natural \ndiamond doesn&rsquo;t mesh with your budget, consider going the moissanite route. This \nsuper hard, scratch-resistant stone gives the look and brilliance of a diamond without the \ncost. That means you can buy a much larger stone with a much smaller price tag. morganite \nengagement rings Her wedding colors don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;blush and \nbashful&rdquo; (name that movie!) to love the delicate pink tint of a morganite gemstone. \nChoose a simple pear-shaped gem with a rose gold band for a monochromatic masterpiece, \nor up the glam factor with a romantic diamond halo surrounding an oval-shaped center \nstone. sapphire engagement rings Are you Team Diana, Team Kate Middleton or somewhere \nin between? If so, consider the royal aesthetic and centuries-old beauty of a sapphire. This \nblue gemstone is great for daily wear owing to its durability, and you can go with a single \nstone on a gold band, make it flashier with surrounding diamonds or white sapphires, or \nchoose a sapphire band with inset stones. If you want a bright pink gemstone that&rsquo;s \nmore vibrant than morganite, select a unique pink sapphire. ruby engagement rings Let the \nfiery passion of your relationship match the center stone of a ruby engagement ring. Choose \na round cut ruby gemstone surrounded by a halo of moissanite gemstones for a deeply \nromantic piece of jewelry. The deep red gives the piece a unique touch that will stand out on \ntheir finger. amethyst engagement rings If you don&rsquo;t go the traditional route, consider \nchoosing a ring that commemorates a February birthday. The deep purple hue of amethyst \npromises a dreamy mystique while incorporating a bit of personalization into the ring. Select \nan opulent design with a rose gold metal to really accentuate the amethyst tone. topaz \nengagement rings Looking for a vintage non-traditional engagement ring? A rich blue topaz \nring gives the look of something old while serving as their &ldquo;something blue.&rdquo; \nSelect a stunning Art Deco-style ring featuring a large, sparkling topaz stunner that promises \nthe wow-factor she craves. aquamarine engagement rings Capture the tranquility of the \nocean or the gentleness of her spirit with the quiet brilliance of an aquamarine ring. Choose \nfrom a range of shapes, sizes and settings, whether she prefers the look of an emerald-cut \nstone surrounded by diamonds in a white gold setting or a vintage-style setting featuring a \npear-shaped aquamarine. stacking band engagement rings If your bride-to-be prefers a \nmore delicate style, go with the look of a single band, whether a plain yellow or white gold \nring, or something with a row of diamonds or gemstones. A single band speaks to classic \nsimplicity, perfect for the minimalist bride who loves clean lines and understated elegance. \nAdd extra bands over time, whether for an anniversary, the birth of a child, a special \noccasion or a holiday. Or plan to propose with three stacked bands that coordinate with her \nsophisticated style. completely unique engagement rings Anything can be an engagement \nring &mdash; a paperclip, a gumball machine treasure, a birthstone band, even a thicker \nmen&rsquo;s wedding band, if that&rsquo;s more their speed. Whatever ring you select will \n\nhave its own special meaning for all of eternity. Design Your Own One-Of-A-Kind Engagment \nRing Can&rsquo;t find a ring that fulfills all of her desires? Make your own! Designing a \ncustom engagement ring will give you the chance to flex some creativity while ensuring you \nfind exactly what you want. You can even get your partner in on the action by going together \nto pick out a stone, select a setting and choose a style. Adding an engraved inscription inside \nthe ring &mdash; whether a wedding date, your initials or a short quotation &mdash; can \nmake it even more unique and meaningful. FAQ's What Makes An Engagement Ring \nAlternative? Anything non-traditional is considered an alternative, meaning the ring \nwon&rsquo;t be your traditional solitaire diamond band. Alternative rings take an unexpected \nmaterial or stray from that traditional diamond into something that better fits with your unique \nstyle. Can I Create My Own Engagement Ring? Absolutely! Your engagement ring should be \na reflection of the wearer and their relationship. Creating your own unique ring is the way to \ngo to ensure that you hit all the must-haves. You can use an online ring tool to virtually build \nand order an engagement ring right from home, or you can work with an in-store jeweler to \nfind your one-of-a-kind masterpiece. What Should I Look For In A Unique Engagement Ring? \nFind an engagement ring that speaks to her personality and style. If she has an affinity for \nmodern and flashy, you might choose a custom morganite ring with a diamond band. If her \nstyle is more pared down and minimalist, a simple band with a few small gemstones may fit \nthe bill. If she wants something completely different, say a thicker silicone band, that works \ntoo! american gem society The American Gem Society (AGS) is a non-profit trade \nassociation of jewelers dedicated to setting, maintaining and promoting the highest \nstandards of ethical and professional behavior through education, accreditation and \ngemological research.

But if you prefer \nsomething different, there are plenty of other shapes available to reflect your unique style \nand taste. what is a diamond shape? Diamonds can be cut into a variety of shapes. There’s \nan option for every bride and budget! Since every diamond shape is cut to varying \nspecifications, they will reflect light differently, giving every shape its own brilliance and fire. \ntypes of diamond shapes round cut diamonds The most popular shape of all time: the round \nbrilliant diamond. Aside from being the most iconic diamond shape, the round diamond is \nmost loved because of its ability to sparkle brighter than any other shape. Because round \ndiamonds are the most popular and most researched shape, they offer the greatest amount \nof flexibility in terms of balancing cut, color, clarity grade and price. Shop round cut diamonds \nprincess cut diamonds The princess cut diamond has a square shape with sharp angles and \na similar facet pattern as the round brilliant diamond, so it sparkles more than other square \nshapes. Sophisticated and eye-catching, the princess cut is perfect for those who love \nsymmetry, clean lines and modern design. Shop princess cut diamonds cushion cut \ndiamonds A cushion cut diamond is a square or rectangular shape with rounded corners, \nlike a cross between a round and a princess cut diamond. A cushion diamond has a soft, \n\nromantic appeal and is sometimes known as a pillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds \nemerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut diamond has the same number of facets as \nround and princess cut diamonds, it is the parallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color \nand clarity. The best way to describe the emerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a \nlarge table and step-cut faceting that creates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric \ndiamond shape is rare: only 3 percent of all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut \ndiamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval cut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated \nsilhouette to appear larger. A brilliant facet pattern means the diamond sparkles as well as a \nround or princess cut, and the exquisite oval shape appeals to any bride, whether she \nprefers classic or more modern looks. Shop oval cut diamonds marquise cut diamonds The \nmarquise shape is an elongated oval with pointed ends and is sometimes referred to as boat \nshaped. The elongated shape maximizes the carat weight of the diamond. Plus, this cut \ncreates the illusion of a larger diamond. Shop marquise cut diamonds pear cut diamonds \nThe pear-shaped diamond can appear modern or vintage, depending on its setting. Its \nelongated teardrop has a narrow pointed top and perfectly rounded bottom. The brilliant cut \nis known for high sparkle, and the elegant pear shape helps to lengthen and flatter its \nwearer's finger. Shop pear cut diamonds radiant cut diamonds Radiant cut diamonds have a \nrectangular shape with cropped corners. The square stone is cut to have a complete \nbrilliant-cut facet pattern. A radiant diamond is also available in a more rectangular shape, \ndepending on its length-to-width ratio. Radiant cut diamond engagement rings are beloved \nfor the sparkle they produce and are usually set in a prong-style solitaire setting. Shop \nradiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon shape has cropped corners and \nmesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. The Asscher, developed during \nthe Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald cut. The Asscher is most \nwell-known for its X-shaped facets that can be seen from above. The Asscher cut is \ncommonly referred to as being “vintage” or “antique.” Shop asscher cut diamonds heart cut \ndiamonds Wear your love loud and proud with a bold symbol of romance: a heart-shaped \ndiamond. Whimsical and sweet, a heart-shaped diamond is just what it sounds like: a \nstunning stone carefully cut into the shape of a heart. how are diamonds cut into shapes? \nDiamond cutting is essentially done by either cleaning or sawing a diamond with a laser or \nsteel blade. There are many other key steps involved in the process, and it takes skilled \nhands to ensure that a diamond is faceted to high standards. frequently asked questions \nWhat Is the Difference Between Diamond Shape and Diamond Cut? The shape of a \ndiamond refers to the external figure or outline of the diamond (pear-shaped, cushion, \nround). The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most? Reflected by their \nwidespread popularity, round diamonds are the pinnacle in brilliance. Most commonly cut \nwith 58 facets that reflect light, round brilliant diamonds are nearly unmatched when it comes \nto shine. How Does Diamond Shape Affect the Price of a Ring? A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size. Because fancy \nshapes, such as pear, oval and marquise, are elongated, they tend to look larger than round \ndiamonds. Which Diamond Shapes Are the Largest? Marquise diamonds have the largest \nface-up area of any diamond cut — approximately 15 percent larger than round diamonds. \nThey also cost less than round diamonds of the same carat. schedule an appointment Not \nsure what diamond shape is best for your partner's future engagement ring?

Diamond \n\ngrading reports, based on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide \nbuyers with assurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have \nbeen graded by some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® \nand GCAL. For every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, \nwhich assesses a stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading \nreport? Diamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at \nindependent grading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on \nimportant characteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are \nincluded in a diamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, \nthe grading lab issues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores \nfor each of the fundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity \nand carat weight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. \nThe most common carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide \nvariety of sizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of \nissued grading reports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes \ncan be identified. Diamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports \ninclude proportions diagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to \nthe culet (the small facet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the \namount of natural color present within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a \ngrade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, \nthe less natural color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also \nmeasure a diamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. \nBluish fluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or \nunder fluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar \ncarat weight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond. Helzberg offers detailed \nreports for every graded diamond we sell. With ethical sourcing of our materials and strict \ndiamond quality standards, we go above and beyond industry standards to provide each \ncustomer with the exceptional quality that has defined the Helzberg name for over a century. \nwhy does helzberg use multiple labs? Our approach to fine jewelry is Quality Over \nEverything, which is why we partner with some of the diamond industry’s most trusted, \n\nindependent grading labs. Their sole purpose is to validate diamond quality through detailed \ngrading reports. Though these reports include ratings or scores based on similar \ncharacteristics, the way they are measured differs from lab to lab — and from natural and lab \ngrown diamonds to gemstones. We look to these experts to ensure you get the highest \nquality stone available, no matter which you choose. more advice engagement buying guide \nFinding the perfect engagement ring can be overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.

Shop multi-diamond engagement \nrings Create your own Looking for a one-of-a-kind engagement ring? Then create your own! \nPartner with our jewelry experts to select your center stone and setting, then have it come to \n\nlife with expert craftsmanship and quality. Get started What is an engagement ring setting? \nThe term &ldquo;setting&rdquo; refers to how a gem is mounted, or set, into a precious \nmetal band. Ideally, an engagement ring's setting should showcase the beauty of the \ngemstone while reflecting the unique personality of the wearer. In addition to determining \nhow the engagement ring will look, the setting will help determine what kind of diamond or \ngemstone you will buy. Channel-set ring Channel settings do not include beads, prongs or \nany fixtures in between the stones. Instead, the gems are set adjacent to each other with \nonly the minimum amount of space separating them. This row of closely set diamonds is \nsecured in place by metal bars on either side. Channel-set diamonds are known for their \ncontinuous sparkle all the way around the ring band. Cathedral setting ring The -->cathedral \nsetting--> features a center gemstone flanked by metal arches that rise from the shank. This \nelevated profile secures the stone in place, while giving it a very distinct profile. It also \ncreates what looks similar to a basket on the underside of the engagement ring. The setting \nis reminiscent of the lovely arches in ceilings and doorways of Gothic-style cathedrals. \nDiamond prong setting types Prong choice is a very important part of the ring selection \nprocess. Strong prongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter \nyour diamond or other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or \nsix prongs evenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- \nand six-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring. Helzberg sells \nsettings without the stone in stores, but not online. find a store How long does it take to set \nan engagement ring?

Unfortunately, improper care can shorten the life of your \npiece and diminish its beauty. Here’s a quick guide to help keep your fine jewelry looking as \ngood as the day you bought it for many years to come. --> jewelry care From regular \ncleaning to smart storage, a lot goes into preserving the look and durability of gems, \nprecious metals and the craftsmanship that holds them all together. While periodic cleaning \ncan help keep your jewelry looking great, you can also help preserve its luster by taking a \nhands-off approach. When you handle your jewelry, the oils from your fingers can diminish its \nappearance. When possible, try to limit how often you handle your jewelry to reduce the \nneed for cleaning. When getting ready for the workday or a fun night on the town, it's always \nbest to put your rings, bracelets and necklaces on last. This will help prevent makeup from \nsticking to your jewelry and keep gems from snagging on clothing and loosening from their \nsettings. You should also familiarize yourself with some fundamental concepts to help you \ncare for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions While it's important to know how to \nproperly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to know what not to do. For regular \ncleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean polishing cloth and specially made \ngem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, ordinary degreasing dish soap is \nthe safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid harsh cleansers and don’t use hot \nwater. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive household cleaners to clean \njewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage many precious gems and \nmetals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot water. Try to limit how \nmuch you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this can cause the color to \nfade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious stones. how to store jewelry \nProper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or tarnished over time. It’s \nimportant to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the tarnishing process. Use a \ndehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep your jewelry out in the \nopen. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store different types of jewelry \nseparately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's best to store your diamond \npieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer gems. You can also wrap \nyour diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage. To best extend the life of your \nmost-loved pieces, we recommend a Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan, which covers inspections \nand repairs on your jewelry purchases. --> --> schedule an appointment Learn about \nHelzberg’s Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan and discover all the jewelry we have to offer.

For example, we set our engagement rings in gold or \nplatinum so your ring will last for years and years. Diamond fashion jewelry, on the other \nhand, is most commonly set in gold, while silver is used to give you a large look at a great \nprice. Of course, there are many types of jewelry metals out there for both women's and \nmen's jewelry alike. Our quick guide to understanding metal types is here to help sort them \nall out. Let's dive in! types of jewelry metals Some of the most common metal types used to \nmake jewelry are gold, silver and platinum. Others include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, \npalladium, cobalt, stainless steel and so many others. Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \n\npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal. While \nmost black titanium in the market is plated, Helzberg only offers Benchmark black titanium, a \ntrue black metal titanium that gets its beautiful look from a proprietary alloying and heating \nprocess. Shop titanium jewelry stainless steel Stainless steel is a metal composed of iron \nalloy and a minimum of 10.5% of chromium. The chromium makes the metal resistant to \nstaining, corroding and oxidation. Stainless steel comes in many grades, meaning it has a \nvariety of uses — including jewelry! This hard, durable and affordable metal is most \n\ncommonly available in an attractive light gray, making it an appealing metal for men's jewelry. \nShop stainless steel jewelry cobalt Often called cobalt chrome, this metal is an excellent \nchoice for men's wedding bands. With its beautiful luster and high durability, cobalt looks \nsimilar to white gold and is a long-lasting choice that will maintain its beauty for years to \ncome. Shop cobalt jewelry zirconium Often confused with titanium, zirconium is a refractive \nmetal commonly used in industrial applications and, more recently, in jewelry. In its natural \nstate, the metal is a silvery gray, but it attains a black appearance after a heating process. A \ndurable, lustrous metal, black zirconium is a bold and handsome metal option. Shop \nzirconium jewelry elysium To create an elysium ring, thousands of diamonds are fused \ntogether with incredible heat under one million pounds of pressure. This creates a 100% \ndiamond piece that's extremely lightweight, hypoallergenic and comfortable. Known for its \nsignature black color, elysium jewelry requires no special care and will never dull, fade, \nscratch or change color. Elysium rings are the hardest and most scratch-resistant rings on \nthe planet and cannot be resized by a jeweler. Shop elysium jewelry damascus steel Named \nfor the capital city of Syria, Damascus steel refers to the forged wootz crucible steel used in \nthe creation of blades and swords from ancient times. Made using iron alloys, modern \nDamascus steel jewelry is crafted by placing contrasting metals of various shades (often \ngray and silver) in layers. These layers are then bonded using high heat and shaped by a \ncomplicated and artistic process resulting in beautiful patterns. Shop damascus steel jewelry \nmeteorite A meteorite is a chunk of debris from a meteoroid originating from outer space. \nMeteorite jewelry is usually made from iron meteorites. While there are all sorts of iron \nmeteorites, some are more common than others, including Gibeon meteorite. A very \ncompelling material for one-of-a-kind men's wedding bands, meteorite is an incredibly rare \nmaterial billions of years in the making. Because it is exceptionally rare, meteorite jewelry is \nexpensive. It also requires extra care due to its high iron content which leaves it susceptible \nto rust. Shop meteorite jewelry frequently asked questions is silver a metal? Silver is a soft, \nlustrous, white transition metal valued for its electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. \nSterling silver only contains 92.5% silver. The rest is usually made up of copper or some \nother metal. is platinum a metal? Platinum is a lustrous, malleable, silvery-white, ductile \nmetal. It is considered one of the transition metals, a group that includes silver, gold, titanium \nand copper. is sterling silver stronger than white gold? Sterling silver is less durable than \nwhite gold, which usually comes with a higher price tag. what's the difference between \nplatinum and stainless steel jewelry? Stainless steel resists wear, dings, dents and scratches \nbetter than platinum. That said, while modern stainless steel jewelry can be very attractive, \nplatinum jewelry still maintains a superior visual appeal and a higher monetary value. which \nis stronger titanium or platinum? When it comes to durability, titanium is much harder than \nplatinum. It doesn't scratch, damage or easily lose its shape. --> schedule an appointment \nSchedule an appointment online or in person to discuss more about moissanite stones and \nsee Helzberg's selection of moissanite rings and jewelry today!

After a while, your engagement ring can start to feel like part of your body. \nIt only makes sense that you would experience a little separation anxiety when it&rsquo;s \nnot on your finger. But should you wear your engagement ring everywhere? The short \nanswer is no, you should not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re \nhere to help you decide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of \ndamage or an unfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your \nengagement ring every day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their \nrings every chance they get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special \ntimes when you really want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond \nengagement ring doesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation \nstarter. Your new ring is an eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing \nimplications. It&rsquo;s only natural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story \nbehind it. Proudly show off your ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. \nDo: A night out Gearing up for a night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with \nyour engagement ring. The brilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any \noutfit, from casual ensembles to elegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate \ndate night or attending a black-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that \nwill help you stand out. When not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances \nwhen it&rsquo;s better to store your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When \nyou&rsquo;re working up a sweat, you risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. \nYou&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to potential abrasions from weights and gym \nequipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool chlorine are other potential hazards found in \nmany fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or cooking Cooking and food prep pose a major \nrisk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products could become lodged in the ring setting, and \nyour ring could slip off when you rinse something off in the sink. When to think twice about \nwearing your engagement ring Sometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear \nyour engagement ring isn&rsquo;t straightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to \nweigh the pros and cons to help you decide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at \nhome. It depends: At work If sitting at a computer and typing up emails, reports and \npresentations sounds like part of your workday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. \nOn the other hand, if you're a mechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, \nyou get the idea), it&rsquo;s best to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: \nTraveling Should you travel with your engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For \nshort trips that pose little risk, you can probably get away with wearing your ring most of the \ntime. You can wear jewelry while going through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing \nthem in a carry-on bag. Before making a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the \npotential risks &mdash; where you&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during \nyour stay. If you're on a tropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose \nyour ring while swimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if \nit&rsquo;s really worth taking a chance on something so close to your heart. Find the perfect \nwedding band to match your engagement ring in-store or online. diamond guide: the 4cs of \n\ndiamonds A breathtaking center stone in an engagement ring or a sparkling accent in a \ndelicate gold pendant, diamonds are forever treasured and always on trend. Read on to \nlearn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right stone for your \nbudget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal fire, sparkle and \nbrilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel overwhelming. \nWhile everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what makes one diamond \nsuperior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. what are the 4cs of \ndiamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for assessing the excellence of \nany diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, color, clarity and carat weight \nwork to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are how gemologists measure \ndiamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry and proportions of the \ndiamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A skilled cutter uses \nprecise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers maximum visual effects, \nincluding brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the scattering of light into \neach color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of light produced by \nreflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends on the quality of \na diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond reaches the hands of \na diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A well-cut diamond will \nappear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear dark and dull. types of \ndiamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes through the side of the \nstone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of the stone before it can be \nreflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces — or facets — represents \nthe quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall brilliance. With well-proportioned \ncuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back through the top of the diamond. \nSuperior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut Diamond Each grading lab uses their \nown grading scale and terminology to determine a diamond's cut, based on the level of \nprecision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color Almost any naturally occurring diamond \nhas some amount of color. How much determines the quality of the diamond. While there are \ncolorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. Anytime you purchase a diamond, you \nshould expect it to have at least some trace amount of natural color. what is diamond color? \nNatural diamonds are the product of geological processes that take billions of years to \ncomplete. The chemical and physical processes yield a wide array of stones which all include \nsome varying amounts of color. In most instances, the less color a diamond has, the higher \nits quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond buyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality \nbased on the amount of color present within the stone. From white to yellow, diamonds \nreceive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. \nMost diamond buyers prefer colorless to near-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and \nJ offering optimal value for a customer's budget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds \nhave little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to the stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop \nof pure water. Because they are so rare, colorless diamonds are often the most valuable. \nNear Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless diamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint \nthat is difficult to see with the naked eye. These stones make up only 2–3 percent of all \nnatural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often the best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in \nthe middle of the diamond color chart. Unmounted faint diamonds often have a faint \nyellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked eye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer \ngreat value, as the color is often difficult to see with the untrained eye, unless compared right \nnext to a stone in the near-colorless or colorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond \ncontains small blemishes (external) and inclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The \nfewer imperfections a diamond has, the more valuable it is. The more imperfections a \ndiamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is diamond clarity? This describes the internal \nand external characteristics of a diamond. A grade is assigned to each stone, with \"IF\" \nreferring to a diamond with inclusions and \"FL\" referencing flawless clarity. Diamond buyers \nwill choose stones with some inclusions to offer the best value to their customers. At \n\nHelzberg, we offer a variety of diamond clarities sure to fit any budget. diamond clarity \ngrades Diamond clarity grades are measured by the amount of inclusions, or imperfections, \nin a stone. The below table provides definitions for each of the common diamond clarity \ngrades, so you can thoughtfully consider how visible imperfections will be. diamond clarity \nchart FL, IF These are flawless diamonds, no matter how closely you look. Flawless and \ninternally flawless are the highest, and rarest, diamond quality clarity grades. vvs1, vvs2 \nThese diamonds have very slight inclusions, visible only under a microscope. These \ninclusions are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see. vs1, vs2 These are very slightly \nincluded, difficult to see with the naked eye and somewhat difficult to see under a \nmicroscope. si1, si2 These imperfections can be seen by the trained eye under 10x \nmagnification. They might still be visible to the naked eye, but harder to see in diamonds \nsmaller than 1 carat. i1, i2, i3 These inclusions are very easy for a trained eye to see under \n10x magnification. They are also often visible to the naked eye, and in the case of I3 \ndiamonds, the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the diamond as well as impact \nits brilliance. diamond carat weight When most people think about diamond quality, their \nminds immediately focus on carat weight. While other factors are also important, carat weight \nis one of the most significant characteristics in determining a diamond's quality and price. \nwhat is a diamond carat? This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The larger \nthe carat, the pricier the diamond, although the other Cs can also work to influence the final \nprice. diamond carat chart Diamonds are available in a variety of sizes, but the most \ncommon diamond sizes range from .25 to 5 carats.

Filing a jewelry claim with your homeowners/renters policy can put you at risk of an \nincreased premium or cancellation of your full homeowners/renters policy. Your existing \npolicy deductible would also apply which means you’ll pay more out of pocket. Coverage \noptions may also be limited in not covering things like loss during travel. What happens if I \nhave a claim? Zillion provides a concierge claims experience by taking care of the repair or \nreplacement with us – keeping you in the loop. As our customer, you won’t be burdened by \nproving ownership of your item, verifying its value, paying a deductible, or negotiating a cash \nsettlement. We take this opportunity to exceed your expectations and remind you why you \nput your trust in Zillion. What Is The Zillion Satisfaction Guarantee? We’re confident you’ll \nlove Zillion. However, you may cancel at any time for a pro-rated refund. Receive a full refund \nif cancelled in the first 30 days. What is the difference between the Helzberg Lifetime Care \nPlan and Zillion Insurance. The Lifetime Care Plan includes free cleanings and inspections, \n\nrepairs, and stone replacements.

But if you prefer something different, there are plenty of other shapes \navailable to reflect your unique style and taste. what is a diamond shape? Diamonds can be \ncut into a variety of shapes. There’s an option for every bride and budget! Since every \ndiamond shape is cut to varying specifications, they will reflect light differently, giving every \nshape its own brilliance and fire. types of diamond shapes round cut diamonds The most \npopular shape of all time: the round brilliant diamond. Aside from being the most iconic \ndiamond shape, the round diamond is most loved because of its ability to sparkle brighter \nthan any other shape. Because round diamonds are the most popular and most researched \nshape, they offer the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of balancing cut, color, clarity \ngrade and price. Shop round cut diamonds princess cut diamonds The princess cut diamond \nhas a square shape with sharp angles and a similar facet pattern as the round brilliant \ndiamond, so it sparkles more than other square shapes. Sophisticated and eye-catching, the \nprincess cut is perfect for those who love symmetry, clean lines and modern design. Shop \nprincess cut diamonds cushion cut diamonds A cushion cut diamond is a square or \nrectangular shape with rounded corners, like a cross between a round and a princess cut \ndiamond. A cushion diamond has a soft, romantic appeal and is sometimes known as a \npillow cut. Shop cushion cut diamonds emerald cut diamonds Although the emerald cut \ndiamond has the same number of facets as round and princess cut diamonds, it is the \nparallel facets that help highlight the stone’s color and clarity. The best way to describe the \nemerald cut is a rectangular shape designed with a large table and step-cut faceting that \ncreates a unique hall-of-mirrors effect. This geometric diamond shape is rare: only 3 percent \nof all the diamonds in the world are emerald cut diamonds. Shop emerald cut diamonds oval \ncut diamonds The oval shape has an elongated silhouette to appear larger. A brilliant facet \npattern means the diamond sparkles as well as a round or princess cut, and the exquisite \noval shape appeals to any bride, whether she prefers classic or more modern looks. Shop \noval cut diamonds marquise cut diamonds The marquise shape is an elongated oval with \npointed ends and is sometimes referred to as boat shaped. The elongated shape maximizes \nthe carat weight of the diamond. Plus, this cut creates the illusion of a larger diamond.

Its elongated teardrop has a narrow pointed top and \nperfectly rounded bottom. The brilliant cut is known for high sparkle, and the elegant pear \nshape helps to lengthen and flatter its wearer's finger. Shop pear cut diamonds radiant cut \ndiamonds Radiant cut diamonds have a rectangular shape with cropped corners. The square \nstone is cut to have a complete brilliant-cut facet pattern. A radiant diamond is also available \nin a more rectangular shape, depending on its length-to-width ratio. Radiant cut diamond \nengagement rings are beloved for the sparkle they produce and are usually set in a \nprong-style solitaire setting. Shop radiant cut diamonds asscher cut diamonds This octagon \nshape has cropped corners and mesmerizing angles that set it apart from any other shape. \nThe Asscher, developed during the Art Deco period, is a blend of the princess and emerald \ncut.

Whimsical and sweet, a heart-shaped diamond is just what it \nsounds like: a stunning stone carefully cut into the shape of a heart. how are diamonds cut \ninto shapes? Diamond cutting is essentially done by either cleaning or sawing a diamond \nwith a laser or steel blade. There are many other key steps involved in the process, and it \ntakes skilled hands to ensure that a diamond is faceted to high standards. frequently asked \nquestions What Is the Difference Between Diamond Shape and Diamond Cut? The shape of \na diamond refers to the external figure or outline of the diamond (pear-shaped, cushion, \nround). The cut of a diamond refers to the dimensions, symmetry, facets and reflective \nqualities of the diamond. Which Diamond Shape Shines the Most? Reflected by their \nwidespread popularity, round diamonds are the pinnacle in brilliance. Most commonly cut \n\nwith 58 facets that reflect light, round brilliant diamonds are nearly unmatched when it comes \nto shine. How Does Diamond Shape Affect the Price of a Ring? A diamond's shape is one of \nthe most important factors impacting price. Choosing a fancy-shaped diamond can actually \nsave you more, compared to a round diamond of similar quality and size. Because fancy \nshapes, such as pear, oval and marquise, are elongated, they tend to look larger than round \ndiamonds. Which Diamond Shapes Are the Largest? Marquise diamonds have the largest \nface-up area of any diamond cut — approximately 15 percent larger than round diamonds. \nThey also cost less than round diamonds of the same carat. schedule an appointment Not \nsure what diamond shape is best for your partner's future engagement ring?

Diamond grading reports, \nbased on internationally recognized diamond grading standards, provide buyers with \nassurance that they are purchasing a quality stone. Many of our diamonds have been graded \nby some of the most trusted third-party labs in the industry, such as AGS, GIA® and GCAL. \nFor every graded diamond, we provide our customers with a grading report, which assesses \na stone's quality based on several key factors. --> what is a diamond grading report? \nDiamond grading reports are obtained by submitting diamonds for evaluation at independent \ngrading laboratories. These reports can help differentiate stones based on important \ncharacteristics that determine quality and aesthetic. what characteristics are included in a \ndiamond grading report? After carefully assessing and analyzing a diamond, the grading lab \nissues a detailed report or grading certificate that includes ratings and scores for each of the \nfundamental characteristics of a diamond — that is, the 4Cs: cut, color, clarity and carat \nweight. --> carat weight This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The most \ncommon carat weights range from .25–5 carats; however, Helzberg carries a wide variety of \nsizes. Shape and cut describe the diamond's shape. More than 50 percent of issued grading \nreports are for round brilliant cut diamonds, but numerous complex shapes can be identified. \nDiamond cuts are graded from “Fair” to “Excellent.” Some grading reports include proportions \ndiagrams that break down a diamond's measurements, from the table to the culet (the small \nfacet at the bottom of a diamond). --> color grade This measures the amount of natural color \npresent within a diamond. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D \n(colorless) to Z (light), for the amount of natural color they contain. Typically, the less natural \ncolor a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. Some grading labs also measure a \ndiamond's fluorescence, which is how intensely the stone glows under UV light. Bluish \nfluorescence can make certain diamonds appear more colorless in natural daylight or under \nfluorescent lamps. This may make them more valuable than diamonds of a similar carat \nweight that do not have fluorescence. --> clarity grade This describes the internal and \nexternal characteristics of a diamond. Most diamonds will have grades ranging from “I” to \n“FL,” with \"I\" referring to a diamond with inclusions (or imperfections) and \"FL\" referencing \nflawless clarity. Some grading reports include plotting diagrams that map a diamond's clarity \ncharacteristics, which include not only the internal inclusions, but also the blemishes on the \ndiamond's surface. --> cut grade This analyzes how well-proportioned the dimensions of a \ndiamond are. Both polish and measurement affect a diamond's cut grade, typically ranging \nfrom “Excellent” to “Poor.” The polish score indicates the quality or degree of smoothness to \nwhich diamond facets have been polished. Measurement is a description in millimeters of the \nwidth and length (in the case of non-round stones) or diameter and depth (in the case of \nround stones). Diamond measurements can vary depending on cut. Diamonds that are cut to \nexacting proportions sparkle more. --> grading number Issued by a grading laboratory, this \nunique number is inscribed on the girdle of the diamond and can't be seen with the naked \neye. The grading number links to a copy of the associated report held by the lab. Often \navailable online, the report provides detailed graded information and comments that are \nspecific to each unique diamond. frequently asked questions why would someone get a \ndiamond certification or diamond grading report? Contrary to common misperceptions, \ndiamond grading reports are not appraisals. They give an unbiased assessment of a \ndiamond. Just as houses have deeds and vehicles have registrations and titles, it only makes \nsense that buyers would seek similar documentation for something as valuable as a \ndiamond. A diamond grading report is your assurance that your diamond is a diamond. It \nalso includes disclosures of any treatments used to enhance clarity or color. From the \nperspective of thoughtful buyers, a reputable diamond grading report gives clear evidence \nthat may help their customer confidently purchase a diamond. Helzberg offers detailed \nreports for every graded diamond we sell. With ethical sourcing of our materials and strict \ndiamond quality standards, we go above and beyond industry standards to provide each \ncustomer with the exceptional quality that has defined the Helzberg name for over a century. \n\nwhy does helzberg use multiple labs? Our approach to fine jewelry is Quality Over \nEverything, which is why we partner with some of the diamond industry’s most trusted, \nindependent grading labs. Their sole purpose is to validate diamond quality through detailed \ngrading reports. Though these reports include ratings or scores based on similar \ncharacteristics, the way they are measured differs from lab to lab — and from natural and lab \ngrown diamonds to gemstones. We look to these experts to ensure you get the highest \nquality stone available, no matter which you choose. more advice engagement buying guide \nFinding the perfect engagement ring can be overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.

Partner with our \njewelry experts to select your center stone and setting, then have it come to life with expert \ncraftsmanship and quality. Get started What is an engagement ring setting? The term \n&ldquo;setting&rdquo; refers to how a gem is mounted, or set, into a precious metal band. \nIdeally, an engagement ring's setting should showcase the beauty of the gemstone while \nreflecting the unique personality of the wearer. In addition to determining how the \nengagement ring will look, the setting will help determine what kind of diamond or gemstone \nyou will buy. Channel-set ring Channel settings do not include beads, prongs or any fixtures \nin between the stones. Instead, the gems are set adjacent to each other with only the \nminimum amount of space separating them. This row of closely set diamonds is secured in \nplace by metal bars on either side. Channel-set diamonds are known for their continuous \nsparkle all the way around the ring band. Cathedral setting ring The -->cathedral setting--> \nfeatures a center gemstone flanked by metal arches that rise from the shank. This elevated \nprofile secures the stone in place, while giving it a very distinct profile. It also creates what \nlooks similar to a basket on the underside of the engagement ring. The setting is reminiscent \nof the lovely arches in ceilings and doorways of Gothic-style cathedrals. Diamond prong \nsetting types Prong choice is a very important part of the ring selection process. Strong \nprongs securely hold the gemstone while still allowing plenty of light to enter your diamond \nor other gemstone. Prongs can be placed at each corner of a ring, with four or six prongs \nevenly spaced around the stone. The most popular prong setting styles are four- and \nsix-prong, although eight- and ten-prong styles can also be found. Prong shape will vary \n\naccording to design. The thicker and more numerous the prongs, the more durable the ring. \nShared prong Commonly used for larger gemstones, shared prong settings hold together \nseveral stones, with each one sharing a set of prongs next to it. The shared prong gives the \ncompelling appearance of an array of gemstones spread across the ring finger with minimal \nmetal exposed. Single-shared prong Single-shared prongs also feature a series of \ngemstones, but with more metal between them. This type of shared prong setting is \ncost-efficient since it saves on materials and doesn't overwhelm the gemstones with the \nunnecessary installation of metal. Pav&eacute; In a pav&eacute; setting, small gemstones or \ndiamonds are held in place with very small metal beads. Because the gems are so closely \nset, it creates a &ldquo;paved&rdquo; look, which earns the style the French name of \npav&eacute;. Pav&eacute; settings provide a twinkling, sparkly effect that makes a ring stand \nout. Eternity Whether they're channel set, cathedral set or pav&eacute; set, eternity rings are \ndesigned to have no visible strip of metal on either side of the diamonds. Eternity rings can \nbe set with diamond gems all the way around the band or with diamonds only halfway set \nacross the visible side of the ring. Frequently asked questions What is the most secure \ndiamond setting? When gems are aligned with the flat surface of the ring's precious metal, it \nis called a flush setting. These are the safest settings for people who work with their hands or \nlead active lifestyles. They are also less expensive ring settings compared to other options. \nWhat is the most popular engagement ring style? While trends come and go, the striking \ndiamond solitaire has long been a favorite when it comes to engagement rings. Solitaire \nsettings look fantastic with almost any diamond shape, but they look especially striking with a \nround brilliant diamond. Can I buy a ring setting without the stone? While most people prefer \nto purchase a setting and stone together, there are exceptions. For instance, some people \nalready own a diamond or wish to source a stone from another existing ring. Helzberg sells \nsettings without the stone in stores, but not online. find a store How long does it take to set \nan engagement ring?

Here’s \na quick guide to help keep your fine jewelry looking as good as the day you bought it for \nmany years to come. --> jewelry care From regular cleaning to smart storage, a lot goes into \npreserving the look and durability of gems, precious metals and the craftsmanship that holds \nthem all together. While periodic cleaning can help keep your jewelry looking great, you can \nalso help preserve its luster by taking a hands-off approach. When you handle your jewelry, \nthe oils from your fingers can diminish its appearance. When possible, try to limit how often \nyou handle your jewelry to reduce the need for cleaning. When getting ready for the workday \nor a fun night on the town, it's always best to put your rings, bracelets and necklaces on last. \nThis will help prevent makeup from sticking to your jewelry and keep gems from snagging on \nclothing and loosening from their settings. You should also familiarize yourself with some \nfundamental concepts to help you care for your jewelry pieces. jewelry care instructions \nWhile it's important to know how to properly care for your jewelry, it's equally important to \nknow what not to do. For regular cleaning, you can wipe down your jewelry with a clean \npolishing cloth and specially made gem and jewelry cleaner. In almost every other instance, \nordinary degreasing dish soap is the safest, most effective way to clean your jewelry. Avoid \nharsh cleansers and don’t use hot water. Never use toothpaste, chlorine bleach or abrasive \nhousehold cleaners to clean jewelry. Avoid abrasive sponges and brushes which damage \nmany precious gems and metals. Many stones are also sensitive to acid, ammonia and hot \nwater. Try to limit how much you expose your jewelry to heat and direct sunlight, since this \ncan cause the color to fade from aquamarine, citrine, kunzite and many other precious \nstones. how to store jewelry Proper storage can help keep jewelry from getting scratched or \ntarnished over time. It’s important to keep your jewelry dry since moisture speeds the \ntarnishing process. Use a dehumidifier to lower the relative humidity of the room if you keep \nyour jewelry out in the open. To keep jewelry from scratching or getting tangled, store \ndifferent types of jewelry separately. Because of the exceptional hardness of diamonds, it's \nbest to store your diamond pieces separate from other jewelry to keep from scratching softer \ngems. You can also wrap your diamond pieces in soft cloths to help avoid any damage. To \nbest extend the life of your most-loved pieces, we recommend a Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan, \nwhich covers inspections and repairs on your jewelry purchases. --> --> schedule an \nappointment Learn about Helzberg’s Lifetime Jewelry Care Plan and discover all the jewelry \nwe have to offer.

For example, we set our engagement rings in gold or \nplatinum so your ring will last for years and years. Diamond fashion jewelry, on the other \nhand, is most commonly set in gold, while silver is used to give you a large look at a great \nprice. Of course, there are many types of jewelry metals out there for both women's and \nmen's jewelry alike. Our quick guide to understanding metal types is here to help sort them \nall out. Let's dive in! types of jewelry metals Some of the most common metal types used to \nmake jewelry are gold, silver and platinum. Others include titanium, tungsten, tantalum, \npalladium, cobalt, stainless steel and so many others. Each one has its benefits and \ndifferences surrounding durability, comfort, luster, beauty and cost. types of gold metals Gold \npurity is measured in karats. When a metal is 100% pure, like 24K gold, it is too soft and \nmalleable to create long-lasting jewelry. Consequently, it must be alloyed with other metals to \ngive it strength. Here's a quick breakdown of the different gold karats you'll encounter and \nwhat they mean: 18k gold 18 parts gold, 6 parts other metals by weight (75% pure) 14k gold \n14 parts gold, 10 parts other metals by weight (58.3% pure) 10k gold 10 parts gold, 14 parts \nother metals by weight (41.7% pure) Gold is alloyed with specific metal types to give it a \nwhite, rose or yellow hue. Depending on your style or priorities, each of these colors offers \ndistinctive characteristics and benefits. white gold White gold has a silver appearance and is \ncomposed of gold that is typically alloyed with white metals such as palladium, platinum, \nsilver and nickel. It is also commonly plated with rhodium to add to its shine and hardness. \nThis beautiful precious metal is a durable, affordable alternative to platinum. To maintain its \nlustrous silvery color, white gold rings must have their rhodium coatings re-plated \nperiodically. yellow gold With its warm color and classic appeal, yellow gold is a popular fine \nmetal that never goes out of style. It is typically alloyed with small amounts of silver and \ncopper to make it more resilient and preserve its timeless shine. A staple of many jewelry \ncollections, yellow gold can be used to craft intricate designs for a unique look. To keep your \nyellow gold pieces looking beautiful, have them polished to maintain their luster. rose gold \nBlushing, beautiful rose gold lends a hint of romance to any ensemble. It is alloyed with \ncopper and silver, giving it a distinct pinkish hue, like a rose (hence the name). The copper is \nwhat gives it a memorable pink coloring. Strong enough for daily wear, rose gold has \nunmistakable vintage appeal, and its lovely color flatters most skin tones. While it looks \ngorgeous with diamonds, it is especially complementary of morganite and other gemstones. \nplatinum metal Five times rarer than yellow gold, platinum is a luxurious metal of exceptional \nquality. Harder, heavier and far more scratch-resistant than other metals, platinum is a \ngorgeous, durable and hypoallergenic option known for its coveted white luster. Unlike white \ngold, naturally white platinum does not need to be re-plated or re-polished to avoid a yellow \nhue. sterling silver Like 24K gold, pure silver is too soft for making jewelry and will lose its \nshape over time. Sterling silver, however, is alloyed with metals like copper to create a harder \nmetal. Sterling silver's affordability and appearance make it great for gift-giving. vermeil \nFeaturing a thick, 2.5-micron layer of gold over sterling silver, vermeil (pronounced ver-may) \nis the highest quality gold plating technique in the industry. Durable enough for everyday \nwear, vermeil offers the look and feel of solid gold without the solid gold price tag. Vermeil is \nnot flash plating, standard gold plating or gold-filled jewelry, all of which use a thin layer of \ngold over cheaper base metals like copper or brass. types of alternative metals These days, \nalternative metals are becoming more and more popular for men's bands because of their \ndistinct appearances, durability and affordability. From tantalum and titanium to cobalt, \nzirconium, meteorite and stainless steel, the following metals offer unique options for a \nvariety of personal styles and needs. tantalum First discovered in 1802, tantalum is rare, \nbeautiful, shiny and dense. Extremely resistant to heat and wear, it has become a popular \nchoice for men's wedding bands, thanks to its unique appearance and durable design. \nSomewhat darker than platinum, tantalum has a rich, masculine color. Tantalum can be \npolished for a brighter, glossy luster or treated to create a flat, matte finish, which brings out \nthe metal's sleek, stylish texture. Shop tantalum jewelry titanium Titanium has superior \n\nstructural integrity and is three times stronger than steel. Titanium is also very lightweight \n(1/3 the weight of gold). Although a very hard and durable metal, titanium can still be \nscratched by abrasive materials like rocks or hardened steel tools. An exceptionally rare form \nof titanium, black titanium has become a popular variation of this popular rare metal. While \nmost black titanium in the market is plated, Helzberg only offers Benchmark black titanium, a \ntrue black metal titanium that gets its beautiful look from a proprietary alloying and heating \nprocess. Shop titanium jewelry stainless steel Stainless steel is a metal composed of iron \nalloy and a minimum of 10.5% of chromium. The chromium makes the metal resistant to \nstaining, corroding and oxidation. Stainless steel comes in many grades, meaning it has a \nvariety of uses — including jewelry! This hard, durable and affordable metal is most \ncommonly available in an attractive light gray, making it an appealing metal for men's jewelry. \nShop stainless steel jewelry cobalt Often called cobalt chrome, this metal is an excellent \nchoice for men's wedding bands. With its beautiful luster and high durability, cobalt looks \nsimilar to white gold and is a long-lasting choice that will maintain its beauty for years to \ncome. Shop cobalt jewelry zirconium Often confused with titanium, zirconium is a refractive \nmetal commonly used in industrial applications and, more recently, in jewelry. In its natural \nstate, the metal is a silvery gray, but it attains a black appearance after a heating process. A \ndurable, lustrous metal, black zirconium is a bold and handsome metal option. Shop \nzirconium jewelry elysium To create an elysium ring, thousands of diamonds are fused \ntogether with incredible heat under one million pounds of pressure. This creates a 100% \ndiamond piece that's extremely lightweight, hypoallergenic and comfortable. Known for its \nsignature black color, elysium jewelry requires no special care and will never dull, fade, \nscratch or change color. Elysium rings are the hardest and most scratch-resistant rings on \nthe planet and cannot be resized by a jeweler. Shop elysium jewelry damascus steel Named \nfor the capital city of Syria, Damascus steel refers to the forged wootz crucible steel used in \nthe creation of blades and swords from ancient times. Made using iron alloys, modern \nDamascus steel jewelry is crafted by placing contrasting metals of various shades (often \ngray and silver) in layers. These layers are then bonded using high heat and shaped by a \ncomplicated and artistic process resulting in beautiful patterns. Shop damascus steel jewelry \nmeteorite A meteorite is a chunk of debris from a meteoroid originating from outer space. \nMeteorite jewelry is usually made from iron meteorites. While there are all sorts of iron \nmeteorites, some are more common than others, including Gibeon meteorite. A very \ncompelling material for one-of-a-kind men's wedding bands, meteorite is an incredibly rare \nmaterial billions of years in the making. Because it is exceptionally rare, meteorite jewelry is \nexpensive. It also requires extra care due to its high iron content which leaves it susceptible \nto rust. Shop meteorite jewelry frequently asked questions is silver a metal? Silver is a soft, \nlustrous, white transition metal valued for its electrical conductivity and decorative beauty. \nSterling silver only contains 92.5% silver. The rest is usually made up of copper or some \nother metal. is platinum a metal? Platinum is a lustrous, malleable, silvery-white, ductile \nmetal. It is considered one of the transition metals, a group that includes silver, gold, titanium \nand copper. is sterling silver stronger than white gold? Sterling silver is less durable than \nwhite gold, which usually comes with a higher price tag. what's the difference between \nplatinum and stainless steel jewelry? Stainless steel resists wear, dings, dents and scratches \nbetter than platinum. That said, while modern stainless steel jewelry can be very attractive, \nplatinum jewelry still maintains a superior visual appeal and a higher monetary value. which \nis stronger titanium or platinum? When it comes to durability, titanium is much harder than \nplatinum. It doesn't scratch, damage or easily lose its shape. --> schedule an appointment \nSchedule an appointment online or in person to discuss more about moissanite stones and \nsee Helzberg's selection of moissanite rings and jewelry today!

When it comes to figuring out your ring size &mdash; or that of your \nspecial someone &mdash; we&rsquo;ve got you covered with easy-measuring tips and tools. \nHow To Figure Out Ring Size Wondering &ldquo;how do I know my ring size?&rdquo; The \nbest way to correctly measure your finger size is to visit your local Helzberg Diamonds store. \nOur knowledgeable associates can help you determine the right size for diamond \nengagement rings, wedding rings, bands, or fashion rings. Not located near a Helzberg \nstore? Here are some other ways to measure your ring size at home. How to measure ring \nsize at home There are a few easy tricks to get a fairly accurate idea of your ring size at \nhome. One way is to find an existing ring that fits correctly on the exact finger you want to \nmeasure. Then, you&rsquo;ll match the inside edge of that ring to the correct diameter on a \nprintable ring size chart. You can also separately measure the inner edge of the ring and use \nthat number (in millimeters) to determine the correct ring size. If you don&rsquo;t have a \nruler, you can also use a strip of paper or a string to measure your ring finger. Print The Ring \nSizing Chart How to measure ring size with string 1 Cut a small strip of flexible string, ribbon, \nthread or dental floss. 2 Wrap it firmly (but not too tight) around your ring finger. 3 Compare \nyour measurement with Helzberg&rsquo;s ring sizing chart. Double and triple check for \naccuracy. Ring sizing tips The average ring size for women is a 6, while the average ring size \nfor men is an 8, but this can vary considerably based on the person’s build. Here are a few \nthings you should consider to ensure an optimal fit: Use an existing ring that fits correctly on \nthe finger that you want to measure. Be sure to account for the width of bands or stacking \nrings. Ensure the rings fit comfortably and are snug enough to stay on but loose enough to fit \nover your knuckle. Remember that engagement and wedding bands are traditionally worn on \nthe left-hand ring finger, while fashion rings can be worn on any finger on either hand.

How much does it cost to size a ring? Since jewelers have to add more \nmaterial, it typically costs more to make a ring larger than to reduce its size. How to resize a \nring Jewelers use various methods to resize rings. If the ring is too big, they will remove a \nsmall portion of the shank. If the ring isn&rsquo;t big enough, jewelers will typically cut the \nbottom of the ring and add a tiny piece of metal to the shank.

It only makes \nsense that you would experience a little separation anxiety when it&rsquo;s not on your \nfinger. But should you wear your engagement ring everywhere? The short answer is no, you \nshould not be wearing your engagement ring all the time. We&rsquo;re here to help you \ndecide when to don your ring and when not to so you can reduce the risk of damage or an \nunfortunate loss. When to wear your engagement ring If you wear your engagement ring \nevery day, you&rsquo;re not alone. Most brides-to-be eagerly flaunt their rings every chance \nthey get &mdash; we relate TK. That said, there are some extra special times when you \nreally want to show off your new jewelry. Do: At a party A diamond engagement ring \ndoesn&rsquo;t just elevate your look. It&rsquo;s also a conversation starter. Your new ring is \nan eye-catching accessory with momentous, life-changing implications. It&rsquo;s only \nnatural that people will be drawn to the diamond and the story behind it. Proudly show off \nyour ring at parties and embrace being the center of attention. Do: A night out Gearing up for \na night on the town? Feel free to punctuate your look with your engagement ring. The \nbrilliance of a diamond ring adds glamor and intrigue to any outfit, from casual ensembles to \nelegant gowns. Whether you&rsquo;re planning an intimate date night or attending a \nblack-tie event, your engagement ring is a versatile accessory that will help you stand out. \nWhen not to wear your engagement ring There are some instances when it&rsquo;s better to \nstore your ring in a safe place. Don't: At the gym When you&rsquo;re working up a sweat, \nyou risk making it easier for your ring to slip off. You&rsquo;re also subjecting your ring to \npotential abrasions from weights and gym equipment. Hand sanitizer and swimming pool \nchlorine are other potential hazards found in many fitness facilities. Don't: When cleaning or \ncooking Cooking and food prep pose a major risk to your ring. The wrong cleaning products \ncould become lodged in the ring setting, and your ring could slip off when you rinse \nsomething off in the sink. When to think twice about wearing your engagement ring \nSometimes, the answer to whether or not you should wear your engagement ring isn&rsquo;t \nstraightforward. In these instances, it&rsquo;s best to weigh the pros and cons to help you \ndecide if you should wear your ring out or keep it safe at home. It depends: At work If sitting \nat a computer and typing up emails, reports and presentations sounds like part of your \nworkday, you&rsquo;re probably in a safe ring space. On the other hand, if you're a \nmechanic, landscape artist, or professional arm wrestler (OK, you get the idea), it&rsquo;s \nbest to temporarily stow your ring in a safe place. It depends: Traveling Should you travel with \nyour engagement ring? This is really a judgment call. For short trips that pose little risk, you \ncan probably get away with wearing your ring most of the time. You can wear jewelry while \ngoing through TSA, but for larger pieces, consider packing them in a carry-on bag. Before \nmaking a decision, however, it&rsquo;s important to know the potential risks &mdash; where \nyou&rsquo;re traveling and what you&rsquo;ll be doing during your stay. If you're on a \ntropical vacation, you could dull your diamond with sunscreen or lose your ring while \nswimming in the ocean. Do your best to weigh the risks, and ask yourself if it&rsquo;s really \nworth taking a chance on something so close to your heart.

Read on to learn how to assess the quality of a diamond, so you can choose the right \nstone for your budget and style. buying a diamond Everyone wants a diamond with optimal \nfire, sparkle and brilliance. With so many options, however, choosing a quality stone can feel \noverwhelming. While everyone's diamond search is unique, it helps to understand what \nmakes one diamond superior to another, so you can make an informed purchasing decision. \nwhat are the 4cs of diamonds? The 4Cs of diamonds are the universal methods for \nassessing the excellence of any diamond, anywhere in the world. With every diamond, cut, \ncolor, clarity and carat weight work to determine its value. Basically, the 4Cs of diamonds are \nhow gemologists measure diamond quality. diamond cut This describes the polish, symmetry \nand proportions of the diamond, which ultimately determine its brilliance, fire and sparkle. A \nskilled cutter uses precise workmanship and artistry to fashion a diamond so it delivers \nmaximum visual effects, including brightness (external and internal reflected light), fire (the \nscattering of light into each color of the rainbow), and scintillation (the sparkle and pattern of \nlight produced by reflections within the diamond). diamond cut quality The cut grade depends \non the quality of a diamond’s finish, proportions and symmetry. When a rough diamond \nreaches the hands of a diamond cutter, they create the shape and cut of the diamond. A \nwell-cut diamond will appear brilliant and sparkly, while a poorly cut diamond may appear \ndark and dull. types of diamond cuts If the cut of a diamond is too deep, some light escapes \nthrough the side of the stone. If the cut is too shallow, light escapes through the bottom of \nthe stone before it can be reflected, thus reducing its brilliance. The pattern of cut surfaces \n— or facets — represents the quality of the cut and has a direct effect on the overall \nbrilliance. With well-proportioned cuts, light reflects from one facet to another, then back \nthrough the top of the diamond. Superior Cut Diamond Shallow Cut Diamond Deep Cut \nDiamond Each grading lab uses their own grading scale and terminology to determine a \ndiamond's cut, based on the level of precision (or the quality of the cut). diamond color \nAlmost any naturally occurring diamond has some amount of color. How much determines \nthe quality of the diamond. While there are colorless diamonds, they are exceptionally rare. \nAnytime you purchase a diamond, you should expect it to have at least some trace amount \nof natural color. what is diamond color? Natural diamonds are the product of geological \nprocesses that take billions of years to complete. The chemical and physical processes yield \na wide array of stones which all include some varying amounts of color. In most instances, \nthe less color a diamond has, the higher its quality rating. diamond color chart Diamond \nbuyers use a chart to rate a diamond's quality based on the amount of color present within \nthe stone. From white to yellow, diamonds receive a grade, from D (colorless) to Z (light), for \nthe amount of natural color they contain. Most diamond buyers prefer colorless to \nnear-colorless stones, with diamonds graded I and J offering optimal value for a customer's \nbudget. Colorless ( D E F ) Colorless diamonds have little to no yellow/brown tint or hue to \nthe stone. To the naked eye, they resemble a drop of pure water. Because they are so rare, \ncolorless diamonds are often the most valuable. Near Colorless ( G H I J ) Near-colorless \ndiamonds contain small traces of yellow/brown tint that is difficult to see with the naked eye. \nThese stones make up only 2–3 percent of all natural diamonds, so they offer rarity at often \nthe best value. Faint ( K ) Faint diamonds fall in the middle of the diamond color chart. \nUnmounted faint diamonds often have a faint yellow/brown hue that is visible to the naked \neye. Once mounted, these warm stones offer great value, as the color is often difficult to see \nwith the untrained eye, unless compared right next to a stone in the near-colorless or \ncolorless range. diamond clarity Every diamond contains small blemishes (external) and \ninclusions (internal) that define their clarity. The fewer imperfections a diamond has, the more \nvaluable it is. The more imperfections a diamond has, the lower the clarity grade. what is \ndiamond clarity? This describes the internal and external characteristics of a diamond. A \ngrade is assigned to each stone, with \"IF\" referring to a diamond with inclusions and \"FL\" \nreferencing flawless clarity. Diamond buyers will choose stones with some inclusions to offer \n\nthe best value to their customers. At Helzberg, we offer a variety of diamond clarities sure to \nfit any budget. diamond clarity grades Diamond clarity grades are measured by the amount \nof inclusions, or imperfections, in a stone. The below table provides definitions for each of the \ncommon diamond clarity grades, so you can thoughtfully consider how visible imperfections \nwill be. diamond clarity chart FL, IF These are flawless diamonds, no matter how closely you \nlook. Flawless and internally flawless are the highest, and rarest, diamond quality clarity \ngrades. vvs1, vvs2 These diamonds have very slight inclusions, visible only under a \nmicroscope. These inclusions are difficult for even a trained gemologist to see. vs1, vs2 \nThese are very slightly included, difficult to see with the naked eye and somewhat difficult to \nsee under a microscope. si1, si2 These imperfections can be seen by the trained eye under \n10x magnification. They might still be visible to the naked eye, but harder to see in diamonds \nsmaller than 1 carat. i1, i2, i3 These inclusions are very easy for a trained eye to see under \n10x magnification. They are also often visible to the naked eye, and in the case of I3 \ndiamonds, the inclusions may affect the structural integrity of the diamond as well as impact \nits brilliance. diamond carat weight When most people think about diamond quality, their \nminds immediately focus on carat weight. While other factors are also important, carat weight \nis one of the most significant characteristics in determining a diamond's quality and price. \nwhat is a diamond carat? This refers to the actual physical weight of the diamond. The larger \nthe carat, the pricier the diamond, although the other Cs can also work to influence the final \nprice. diamond carat chart Diamonds are available in a variety of sizes, but the most \ncommon diamond sizes range from .25 to 5 carats.
